The study investigated the relationship between timely graduation and academic and institutional factors
for a cohort of Engineering students at a South African university. The sample was restricted to 1595
incoming students beginning during 2009–2011 who were tracked to 2016, allowing for an eight-year
graduation period for the initial cohort. Both descriptive statistics and regression models were employed
in the analysis. The results demonstrate that the characteristic proﬁle of a student graduating on time in
the Engineering programme is likely to be non-African, have high admission point scores (above 40),
pass more than 75% of their credits in the ﬁrst year, have ﬁnancial aid and make regular use of
Supplemental Instruction. In other words, students who haveﬁnancial and prior academic advantages
are the most likely graduates. These results suggest that universities should give serious consideration
to academic support andﬁnancial aid provision.

Introduction
Concerns about student retention and throughput are endemic to higher education institutions (HEIs)
and have been the subject of research and policy debates since the massiﬁcation of higher education
in South Africa (Manik,2015; Scott,2012). Studies mostly drawn from theﬁeld of education and aca-
demic development (see Scott, Yeld & Hendry,2007; Boughey,2005) have laid the conceptual foun-
dations for both scholarly inquiry and policy initiatives. The consensus from these studies is that there
is low participation in higher education which is compounded by high attrition (Fisher & Scott,2011)
and is largely driven by the inequities in education attainment that the country has struggled to
address since the advent of democracy. Although the South African government has increased edu-
cation campaigns and invested in access to and success in higher education since then (Rarieya,
Sanger & Moolman,2014), there is a body of research which points to disparities in educational attain-
ment across racial and socio-economic lines, a status quo which perpetuates intergenerational
inequalities (Spaull,2015; Rarieya et al.,2014).
Amidst these concerns with attrition and participation in higher education is an increasing demand for
Engineering skills in South Africa, the shortage of which poses a long-term challenge for social and
economic development (Fisher,2011). Undoubtedly university graduation is a measure of skill injec-
tion into the labour market (Alais,2017). However, the available evidence suggests that 50% of
students entering higher education leave prior to graduation (Department of Higher Education and
Training, 2016). While Engineering programmes tend to have lower dropout rates than otherﬁelds
(Pocock, 2012), there are still concerns that the students are taking a long period of time to graduate.
The Engineering Council of South Africa throughput study (Fisher,2011) found that completion in
minimum time ranged from 10% to about 45% at the different universities with total completion rates

Introduction
Concerns about student retention and throughput are endemic to higher education institutions (HEIs)
and have been the subject of research and policy debates since the massiﬁcation of higher education
in South Africa. Studies mostly drawn from theﬁeld of education and academic development have laid the conceptual foun-
dations for both scholarly inquiry and policy initiatives. The consensus from these studies is that there
is low participation in higher education which is compounded by high attrition and is largely driven by the inequities in education attainment that the country has struggled to
address since the advent of democracy. Although the South African government has increased edu-
cation campaigns and invested in access to and success in higher education since then, there is a body of research which points to disparities in educational attain-
ment across racial and socio-economic lines, a status quo which perpetuates intergenerational
inequalities.
Amidst these concerns with attrition and participation in higher education is an increasing demand for
Engineering skills in South Africa, the shortage of which poses a long-term challenge for social and
economic development. Undoubtedly university graduation is a measure of skill injec-
tion into the labour market. However, the available evidence suggests that 50% of
students entering higher education leave prior to graduation. While Engineering programmes tend to have lower dropout rates than otherﬁelds, there are still concerns that the students are taking a long period of time to graduate.
The Engineering Council of South Africa throughput study found that completion in
minimum time ranged from 10% to about 45% at the different universities with total completion rates"
Bengesai - 2018 - An Analysis of Academic and Institutional Factors Affecting Graduation Among Engineering Students at.pdf,"ranging between 35 and 60%. The Council for Higher Education’s( 2013) review of undergraduate pro-
grammes also found that approximately 40% of Engineering students graduate inﬁve years. Similar
concerns with low throughput in Engineering have been raised in other countries (Geisinger &
Raman, 2013, for the USA; Godfrey, Aubrey & King,2010, for Australia).
Clearly, such high attrition rates are a signiﬁcant problem for both students and higher education
institutions. For instance, most of these students are likely to leave higher education institutions
having accrued debts in unpaid tuition fees (Pocock,2012). Even in cases where the tuition fees
are fully paid, such students might not easily make up the lost fees through employment. This is
because individuals with less than a university degree are likely to experience lower lifetime earnings
(Thurlow & Johnson,2011). Evidence from Statistics South Africa (2014) reveals that∼23.6% of indi-
viduals with only a high school leaving certiﬁcate were living in poverty compared with less than 5%
(one in 20) of those with a tertiary education. Cast in this way, failure to graduate from university
points to educational inequality and raises questions such as: what are the factors which inﬂuence uni-
versity graduation in South Africa? Answering this question is important for HEIs which must operate
like any other business, where the losses and gains are known. In addition, the use of statistical
methods in answering this question provides empirical evidence with a high degree of accuracy
which can be used in measuring evidence and planning.
Determinants of University Graduation
Studies have identiﬁed a range of student background factors which inﬂuence academic outcomes
(see for instance the recent study by Gershenfeld, Hood & Zhan,2016). In South Africa, the issues
of race, family socio-economic status (Branson, Hofmeyr & Lam,2014) and a historically differentiated
education system have been brought to the fore (Spaull,2015). Students who come from disadvan-
taged backgrounds have been found to have negative educational outcomes (Spaull,2015; Scott
et al.,2007) which have been attributed to socio-economic status, race, language and the quality of
the educational system. Regarding gender, there is consensus that female participation at all edu-
cational levels has improved, with females outperforming their male counterparts in some cases
(Moletsane & Reddy, 2011). However, there are still concerns that gender inequality persists in
other forms such as the uptake of Science Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects
(Raireya et al.,2014; Moletsane & Reddy,2011).
Persistence studies in Engineering education have also identiﬁed factors that lead students to drop
out from Engineering programmes. A systematic review of literature on persistence in Engineering in
the USA (Geisinger & Raman,2013) found that students drop out because of the classroom and aca-
demic climate; grades and conceptual understanding; self-efﬁcacy and self-conﬁdence; high school
preparation; career aspirations; and race and gender. In a review of journal articles on science edu-
cation in South Africa, Venkat, Adler, Rollnick, Setati & Vhurumuku (2009) pointed to the effect of meta-
cognition, teaching approaches and communication on student success in mathematics and science.
A study by Pocock (2012) found thatﬁnancial reasons and academic preparedness were the major
reasons leading to student attrition in Engineering at a South African university while an earlier
study by Jawitz (1995) established that academic performance in theﬁrst year was a good predictor
for future academic success in Engineering programmes.
While the available evidence points to several factors which affect student success in HEIs, there is
limited quantitative research in South Africa which has brought all these factors together. Where these
have been explored, the tendency has been to provide conceptual understandings (Manik,2015)o r
examine the perceptions of a limited number of students through focus group interviews (Moodley &
Singh, 2015). Further, the inclination in throughput studies has been to report the graduation rates
in terms of percentage completed per cohort (Letseka & Maile,2008), while taking into consideration
a limited number of factors such as admission point scores, gender and race. However, the low
throughput rates, especially for the African students (Council for Higher Education,2013
), are increas-
ingly putting pressure on higher education institutions to ensure that students graduate. Students on
the other hand have called on institutions to be accountable for the quality of education they offer

Bengesai - 2018 - An Analysis of Academic and Institutional Factors Affecting Graduation Among Engineering Students at.pdf,"and have questioned the enduring inequities in student outcomes through protest movements such as
#RhodesMustFall and #FeesMustFall (Mubangizi,2016). These pressures are pushing HEIs to recon-
sider the way things have always been done and toﬁnd new solutions to the crises (Dhunpath, Amin &
Msibi, 2015). One such way is the use of institution-wide data collected from a range of sources to have
a moreﬁne-grained insight into student achievement. The modest research using survival analysis has
enabled researchers to explore how some of these factors affect the length of time (in years) it takes
students to graduate (Zewotir, North & Murray,2015; Murray,2014). We also acknowledge Pocock’s
(2012) study on leaving rates and reasons for leaving in an Engineering faculty. However, still little is
known about how individual, institutional and academic factors come together to inﬂuence timely
graduation in Engineering. The current study sought to take the existing evidence further by examining
in the same analysis the effect of multiple factors on student throughput.
Theoretical Perspectives
This study is informed by Tinto’s model of student integration (Tinto,1993) and Swail’s retention model
(Swail, 1995). Tinto (1993) theorised that students who manage to integrate both academically and
socially are more likely to persist and graduate from university. Further, he reasoned that active
student engagement was the pillar of student success which focused on how students learn, rather
than how students should be taught (Tinto,1999). In addition, the extent to which a student is able
to integrate academically is dependent on his or her pre-university characteristics such as schooling,
family background and prior academic achievement. Like Tinto, Swail’s theory (1995) identiﬁed ﬁve
pillars of student success, each representative of critical service departments in most universities:
ﬁnancial aid; recruitment and admissions; curriculum and instruction; academic services; and
student services. Both of these models have inﬂuenced a number of studies in South Africa (for
instance Pocock,2012; Ramrathan & Pillay,2015).
In this study, it is assumed that academic factors such as theﬁrst-year aggregate credits, and insti-
tutional factors such as university-based residence, supplemental instruction andﬁnancial aid increase
the likelihood of graduating. In addition, we assume that factors such as admission point scores and
the socio-economic status of the school where a student did his or her high school should be associ-
ated with degree persistence.
Methodology
The data for this study were drawn from the cohort data archived in the department of Institutional Intel-
ligence at the University of KwaZulu–Natal. This dataset contained information on student biographical
factors such as race and gender; academic characteristics— admission point scores and academic
performance in theﬁrst year; and institutional factors— ﬁnancial aid and residence status. This data
set was supplemented with data from the School of Engineering on uptake of Supplemental Instruction
(SI), a peer learning programme that is attached to traditionally difﬁcult courses with the aim of enhan-
cing student performance and retention (Malm, Bryngfors & Mö rner, 2012). Although the SI programme
is available to all students, attendance is voluntary. The sample for this study comprised incoming stu-
dents beginning 2009–2011 who were tracked to 2016, allowing for an eight-year graduation period for
the initial cohort. The study took a census approach and examined the entire population ofﬁrst-year
incoming students into the Engineering programme for 2009 (456), 2010 (502) and 2011 (637), resulting

measure of the year-to-year retention (Geisinger & Raman,2013). Therefore, this indicator did not

Bengesai - 2018 - An Analysis of Academic and Institutional Factors Affecting Graduation Among Engineering Students at.pdf,"time,5= regulation time + 1 year,6= regulation time + 2 years and above)) measured the time individ-
uals took to complete their degree programme. The Engineering programme is a four year qualiﬁcation;
therefore, students who graduate in four years are deemed to have graduated in the regulation time.
Like the graduation, this variable was restricted to graduation within the initial registered qualiﬁcation.
Independent Variables
Demographic data
Demographic data included data on gender and race. Owing to the small sample size for the Indians,
Whites and Coloureds, and in order to avoid over- or under-estimating the coefﬁcients in the regression
analysis, the race variable was collapsed into two categories to represent (1 = Other, 2 = African; the
term African as used in this paper refers to black South Africans).
Academic data
For the Academic data two sets of academic data were used. Theﬁrst was the pre-university academic
data (admission point scores, APS) and university level, i.e. students’credits accumulated at the end of
the ﬁrst year (<75 = 1, >75 = 2). The APS were coded as a four-level categorical variable (0 = alterna-
tive qualiﬁcation; 1 = 30–35; 2 = 36–39; 3 = 40–48). This categorisation was based on the trends
observed in the data regarding admission into the various Engineering disciplines at the University
of KwaZulu–Natal. We also removed students who had APS points below 30 (nine cases) from the
analyses which included APS scores. We assumed that, since this group had very low APS scores,
they would perform differently from those whose APS scores were above 30. Students who had
alternative entry qualiﬁcations would have written different school leaving examinations from the
National Senior Certiﬁcate written in government-funded schools.
Institutional data
Pre-university institutional data included school ranking quintile 1 being the lowest and most disadvan-
taged and quintile 5 the highest and most advantaged school. To stabilise the co-efﬁcient in the
regression analyses, quintiles 1–3 were combined since they constituted a small proportion of the
sample. Moreover, these quintiles are generally classiﬁed as disadvantaged; thus, the combination
did not alter the characteristics of the original data. University-level institutional data included SI attend-
ance registers,ﬁnancial aid status (1 = yes, 2 = no) and whether or not a student had university resi-
dence (1 = yes, 2 = no). SI attendance was coded as a three-level categorical variable (0 = never
attended; 1 = some attendance; 2 = regularattendance). Students who attended at least ﬁve SI
sessions in a given module were considered regular attendees.
Analytical Strategy
Both descriptive statistics and regression models were employed in the analysis. For the dependent
variable graduation (0 = no, 1 = yes), four logistic regression models were estimated. Model 1 exam-
ined the effect of demographic factors, while Model 2 included pre-university characteristics (APS
and school quintile). In Model 3, the student’s academic performance at the end of theﬁrst university
year was controlled for while theﬁnal Model 4 adjusted for institutional (university) factors (academic
support, residence andﬁnancial aid).
For the dependent variabletime to graduation, two multinomial models were estimated. Theﬁrst
model included independent effects of each of the variables while the second model included all of
the variables.

Bengesai - 2018 - An Analysis of Academic and Institutional Factors Affecting Graduation Among Engineering Students at.pdf,"Exploratory Data Analysis
There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in graduation rates between males (47.6%) and
females (49.0%). Only 37.5% of the African students had graduated by 2016 relative to 53.5% of
the other races (Indian, White and Coloured).
Only 30% of students from lower quintile schools had graduated as compared with 59.6 and 50.9% of
those from quintiles 4 and 5 respectively. As expected, most students with high APS scores (40–48,
67.3%) had graduated. In comparison, only 28.7% of those with APS scores between 30 and 35,
40.6% of those with APS scores between 36 and 39 APS scores, and 33.9% of those with alternative
APS scores had graduated by the same date. In terms ofﬁrst-year accumulated credit points, 66.4%
students who had passed more than 75% of their total credit points at the end of theﬁrst year had
graduated, compared with only 5% of those who did not obtain 75% of theirﬁrst-year credits. Most
of the students who made regular use (74.7%) or some use (70.2%) of SI sessions had graduated rela-

An Analysis of Academic and Institutional Factors Affecting Graduation Among Engineering Students at a
South African University 141","Exploratory Data Analysis
There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in graduation rates between males (47.6%) and
females (49.0%). Only 37.5% of the African students had graduated by 2016 relative to 53.5% of
the other races (Indian, White and Coloured).
Only 30% of students from lower quintile schools had graduated as compared with 59.6 and 50.9% of
those from quintiles 4 and 5 respectively. As expected, most students with high APS scores (40–48,
67.3%) had graduated. In comparison, only 28.7% of those with APS scores between 30 and 35,
40.6% of those with APS scores between 36 and 39 APS scores, and 33.9% of those with alternative
APS scores had graduated by the same date. In terms ofﬁrst-year accumulated credit points, 66.4%
students who had passed more than 75% of their total credit points at the end of theﬁrst year had
graduated, compared with only 5% of those who did not obtain 75% of theirﬁrst-year credits. Most
of the students who made regular use (74.7%) or some use (70.2%) of SI sessions had graduated rela-
tive to 28.7% of those who had never attended an SI session. More than half of the students who had
ﬁnancial aid (54.1%) had graduated by 2016. Regarding university residence, 51.8% of those who did
not live in university residences had graduated by the same period. There was a low graduation rate
(34.2%) among students who stayed in university residences. Most of our variables signiﬁcantly pre-
dicted graduation from the Engineering programme withp-values <0.005. The gender variable was not

taken to graduate.Figure 1, therefore, presents the descriptive statistics for time taken to graduate per"
Bengesai - 2018 - An Analysis of Academic and Institutional Factors Affecting Graduation Among Engineering Students at.pdf,"cohort, 2009–2011. Students who took six years to complete and those who were still registered for the
same Engineering programme were grouped together for this analysis. This grouping was based on
the plausible assumption that, across all cohorts, the ongoing students would have been registered
for the Engineering programme for at least six years. A total of 696 students were also excluded at
this stage of the analysis as they had either dropped out (N = 579) or had been excluded (N = 117)
from the Engineering programme.
It can be seen fromFigure 1that 31% of students from the 2009 cohort, and 37% from both the 2010
and 2011 cohorts, had graduated in the regulation time. Theﬁve-year completion rate ranged from
33% for the 2011 cohort and 37 and 38% for the 2009 and 2010 cohorts, respectively. Thirty-two
per cent of students from the 2009 cohort were either ongoing or had completed in six years as com-
pared with 25% from the 2010 cohort and 30% from the 2011 cohort.
Regression Analysis
Tables 2and 3 present results from the regression analysis and seek to answer the question: is there a
particular combination of factors which increases the probability of graduating amongst Engineering
students? This analysis presents the crude graduation rates from the Engineering programme and
does not take into consideration the time taken to graduate.
In Model 1 (Table 2), relative to African students, other (Indians, Coloureds and Whites) students
were 92% [1 − exp(1.921 × 100)] more likely to graduate. This effect was consistent across all
models, increasing the most in Model 4, when institutional factors were added. In Model 2, male stu-
dents were up to 56% more likely to graduate than females, while the effect of lower quintile schools
was positive but not statistically signiﬁcant. Students with 40–48 APS scores were up to 5 times more
likely to graduate, while those with 36–39 APS scores were 1.7 times likely to also graduate relative to
those with 30–35 points.
The positive effect of alternative entry points on graduation was not statistically signiﬁcant. In Model
3, the credits accumulated showed the greatest positive effect on graduation (odds, 31.95). That is,
students who passed more than 75% of theirﬁrst-year credits were up to approximately 32 times
more likely to graduate than those who failed to acquire 75% of theirﬁrst-year credits. In theﬁnal
model, both regular and some attendance of SI sessions increased the probability of graduating by
up to 4 times. Havingﬁnancial aid increased the odds of graduating by about 34% while the results
for residence on campus were not statistically signiﬁcant.
Using the time taken to graduate measure (Table 3), the results demonstrate that being male and
non-African was positively associated with graduating in four or ﬁve years. The effect of lower
school quintiles (1–3) was negative for both individuals who took four orﬁve years to graduate,
although this was not statistically signiﬁcant in the Full Models. The effect of quintile 4 was not statisti-
cally signiﬁcant in all models. Higher admission point scores (40–48 points) increased the odds of
graduating in regulation time by the greatest factor of 7.9, although this effect weakened for those

sis, however, shows that passing more than 75% of theﬁrst-year credits was also beneﬁcial for gradu-
ating in regulation time plus one year and increased the probability by a factor of 9.1, univariate model
and 8.7, full model. Some SI attendance increased the odds of on-time graduation by about 70% (uni-

supplementary analyses where we compared African vs Indian students only as these racial groups
had comparable numbers of students. Still, our results showed that African students had a lower

Bengesai - 2018 - An Analysis of Academic and Institutional Factors Affecting Graduation Among Engineering Students at.pdf,"There is literature which has demonstrated that entry level qualiﬁcations inﬂuence timely graduation
because they are associated withﬁrst-year academic performance. For instance, Bush (2012) found
that students who came in with high entry points attained consistently better grades than those with
lower points. This evidence is further supported by Jansen (2004) and by McKenzie and Schweitzer
(2001) who suggest that students who perform exceptionally well in secondary school are more
likely to do well throughout their academic career. However, in South Africa, the relevance of admis-
sion point scores for university success has been questioned (Schaap & Luwes,2013). This is largely
due to the inadequacies of the curriculum and the differences in educational opportunities and stan-
dards at the school level (Spaull,2015). These criticisms notwithstanding, the studies by Bokana
and Tewari (2014) as well as Naidoo, Motala and Joubert (2013) found that students with higher
APS scores (above 40) had better education outcomes in university. Thus, we conclude, similar to
these prior studies, that students with higher APS scores are more likely to graduate in the
minimum time.
Prior research has shown that lower school SES associates negatively with educational outcomes
(Visser, Juan & Feza, 2015; Spaull, 2015). Thus, we expected that school quintile would be a
potent indicator of university performance. However, our results indicate that school quintile had a
negative but insigniﬁcant effect on graduation rates. However, these results must be interpreted
with a caveat. The variable was unevenly distributed, with more students coming from quintile 5
schools. When disaggregated by race, less than 100 African students came from quintile 5 schools,
suggesting that most students in the Engineering programmes were non-Africans. This presents a
challenge for regression analysis with unequal sample sizes and can potentially destabilise the co-efﬁ-
cient. Thus, these results should not be used to suggest that school quintile has no effect on graduation
rates.
The ﬁndings from this study also provide evidence of the efﬁcacy of SI as an academic support
mechanism and show that students who regularly attended SI were more likely to graduate and in
minimum time. This result is consistent withﬁndings from Bowles, McCoy and Bates (2008) who
found that regular uptake of SI increased timely graduation by about 11%. Malm, Bryngfors and
Mö rner (2015) found a positive correlation between regular SI attendance credit attainment and stu-
dents performance during the ﬁrst year of Engineering studies. In addition, there are studies,
drawing from Tinto’s theory of retention, which have demonstrated that students who are actively
involved in academic support services such as SI (Cuseo, Fecas & Thompson,2007) have better out-
comes. This effect is elevated if students make use of such services as early as theirﬁrst year of study
(Cuseo et al.,2007). However, given that SI attendance is voluntary, and therefore students self-select
to attend, there is a need to understand the proﬁle of students who make use of it. It could be that the
observed effect might not be due to SI attendanceper se,but rather due to other unobserved factors
such as student motivation. This limitation notwithstanding, the results from this study suggest that SI is
an important condition for student success (Tinto,1999) and, hence, a strategy that can enhance reten-
tion and increase throughput.
The ﬁnding that performance inﬁrst year leads to persistence is echoed in prior research (Gershen-
feld, Hood & Zhan,2016; Jawitz,1995). Although theﬁrst year is acknowledged as a critical transition
which lays the foundation for subsequent academic success and persistence in South Africa (Manik,
2015) and even with different interventions put in place to support students, there is limited research
from South Africa exploring the role of theﬁrst-year academic performance on graduation rates. It
may also be worth noting that Engineering is a structured degree, where progression depends on
the successful completion of prior modules. Hence, failing a module threatens a student’s chances
of completing the degree on time. This perhaps explains why, in addition to what the literature says
about integration, acquiring more than 75% of theﬁrst-year credits showed the greatest effect on
timely graduation.
This brings our attention toﬁnancial aid and university residence. Our results show that, for the most
part, ﬁnancial aid had a positive effect on crude graduation rates and the four-year graduation rate rela-
tive to those who take six years and above. The studies by Pocock (2012) and Bokana (2010) both
found that, apart from academic factors, lack ofﬁnancial aid was one of the main reasons why students
did not persist to graduation. Theﬁnding thatﬁnancial aid may be able to improve graduation rates is

(Visser, Juan & Feza, 2015; Spaull, 2015). Thus, we expected that school quintile would be a
potent indicator of university performance. However, our results indicate that school quintile had a
negative but insigniﬁcant effect on graduation rates. However, these results must be interpreted
with a caveat. The variable was unevenly distributed, with more students coming from quintile 5
schools. When disaggregated by race, less than 100 African students came from quintile 5 schools,
suggesting that most students in the Engineering programmes were non-Africans. This presents a
challenge for regression analysis with unequal sample sizes and can potentially destabilise the co-efﬁ-
cient. Thus, these results should not be used to suggest that school quintile has no effect on graduation
rates.
The ﬁndings from this study also provide evidence of the efﬁcacy of SI as an academic support
mechanism and show that students who regularly attended SI were more likely to graduate and in
minimum time. This result is consistent withﬁndings from Bowles, McCoy and Bates (2008) who
found that regular uptake of SI increased timely graduation by about 11%. Malm, Bryngfors and
Mö rner (2015) found a positive correlation between regular SI attendance credit attainment and stu-
dents performance during the ﬁrst year of Engineering studies. In addition, there are studies,
drawing from Tinto’s theory of retention, which have demonstrated that students who are actively
involved in academic support services such as SI (Cuseo, Fecas & Thompson,2007) have better out-
comes. This effect is elevated if students make use of such services as early as theirﬁrst year of study
(Cuseo et al.,2007). However, given that SI attendance is voluntary, and therefore students self-select
to attend, there is a need to understand the proﬁle of students who make use of it. It could be that the
observed effect might not be due to SI attendanceper se,but rather due to other unobserved factors
such as student motivation. This limitation notwithstanding, the results from this study suggest that SI is
an important condition for student success (Tinto,1999) and, hence, a strategy that can enhance reten-
tion and increase throughput.
The ﬁnding that performance inﬁrst year leads to persistence is echoed in prior research (Gershen-
feld, Hood & Zhan,2016; Jawitz,1995). Although theﬁrst year is acknowledged as a critical transition
which lays the foundation for subsequent academic success and persistence in South Africa (Manik,
2015) and even with different interventions put in place to support students, there is limited research
from South Africa exploring the role of theﬁrst-year academic performance on graduation rates. It
may also be worth noting that Engineering is a structured degree, where progression depends on
the successful completion of prior modules. Hence, failing a module threatens a student’s chances
of completing the degree on time. This perhaps explains why, in addition to what the literature says
about integration, acquiring more than 75% of theﬁrst-year credits showed the greatest effect on
timely graduation.
This brings our attention toﬁnancial aid and university residence. Our results show that, for the most
part, ﬁnancial aid had a positive effect on crude graduation rates and the four-year graduation rate rela-
tive to those who take six years and above. The studies by Pocock (2012) and Bokana (2010) both
found that, apart from academic factors, lack ofﬁnancial aid was one of the main reasons why students
did not persist to graduation. Theﬁnding thatﬁnancial aid may be able to improve graduation rates is"
Bengesai - 2018 - An Analysis of Academic and Institutional Factors Affecting Graduation Among Engineering Students at.pdf,"important, especially considering the recent spurt of no-fees campaigns in South African universities.
In this regard,ﬁnancial aid remains a central factor hindering students’graduation outcomes and these
ﬁndings call on universities to reconsider student funding. Finally, we found that staying in university
residence was negatively associated with graduation rates for the Engineering cohort. International
studies have shown that students who have on campus residence have better outcomes as they
are more likely to have more time to study (López Turley & Wodtke,2010). However, in South
Africa, university residence has been the least investigated determinant of university persistence.
Therefore, there are fewer comparable studies. The PhD study by Bokana (2010) used both qualitative
and quantitative methods and found that university residence was not the most ideal for a number of
reasons. These include lack of safety and security, irregularity of public transport to or from the univer-
sity and unhygienic living conditions. It may also be worth noting that University of KwaZulu–Natal is a
non-residential university since most of the students stay at home. Supplemental analysis, available on
request, also showed that most of the students who stayed in residences came from the lower quintile
schools. Thus, apart from the conditions in the residences, there is a possibility that students who live in
university residences also come from disadvantaged backgrounds.
There are several practical implications for theseﬁndings. Firstly, the relationship between Sup-
plemental Instruction and throughput should be given serious consideration by university departments,
administrators and the Department of Education. This needs to be done in an evidence-based manner,
thus, additional work needs to be undertaken to establish the effect of SI, while taking into consider-
ation the self-selection bias. Secondly, since academic performance in theﬁrst year is positively
associated with timely graduation, universities should consider investing in more academic support
in theﬁrst year as well as coming up with early warning systems to identify students at risk of failing
the ﬁrst year. Lastly, the impact ofﬁnancial aid on academic attainment should be of interest to
policy makers and efforts should be made to ensure that the majority of students getﬁnancial aid.
The results from this study should be considered in the context of the study’s weaknesses. First, the
analysis was limited to the factors available in the data. As such, there are questions which may arise,
but cannot be addressed using this data. For instance, other variables of interest would have been
family socio-economic status, students’study habits and metacognition. In South Africa, language is
a major determinant of student learning and there is a need for research which also models the
effect of language on graduation rates. In addition, the methods of analysis used in the study do not
allow for causal inferences. Hence, they should be interpreted as associations between the variables
investigated and timely graduation. Combining theseﬁndings with qualitative data might also provide a
deeper grained understanding of how these factors work together to inﬂuence academic outcomes.
