Abstract—Blended learning is increasingly used in college 
teaching, and formative evaluation has become the main method 
for assessing student performance.  Based on the formative 
evaluation data of an existing course, how to model, analyze and 
predict the possible problems of students in the future learning 
process and give rec ommendations on learning strategy are 
problems worthy of in -depth study. In this paper, Apriori 
algorithm was used to perform association analysis on the 
formative evaluation data of the Fundamentals of Programming 
course in Nankai University , the results indicate that there are 
strong association rules between SPOC video scores, case study 
assignments scores, etc. K-Means algorithm was used to perform 
cluster analysis on SPOC platform score s, offline course scores 
and final exam score s, the results indicat e that the advantages 
and disadvantages of students of different categories are 
consistent in two semesters. Finally, the clustering results of the 
first semester were added to the data set,  Random Forest was 
used for feature selection , and four ensemble l earning models 
were trained respectively  to predict final exam grades . The 
results show that the XGBoost model work s best, the accuracy 
of predicting the final exam grade s of two semesters is 77.02% 
and 80.10%, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, the emergence of blended learning 
pedagogy is rapidly changing the traditional mode of teaching 
and learning. Some studies have shown that blended learning 
has better learning effect than traditional teaching approach   
[1], [2]. There have been many studies and cases that use d 
blended learning data to mine and analyze student 
performance. Lu et al. [3] made early predictions of students’ 
final academic performance in a blended calculus course. This 
study collected real data from 21 variables in the blended 
course, and applied principal component regression to predict 
students’ final academic performance. Zacharis et al. [4] used 
CART decision tree to classify the students and predict who is 
at risk based on the data from four online activities (message 
exchange, creating wiki content groups, opening course files, 
and online testing). Shin et al. [5] used clickers to record 
attendance, quiz performance, and perform d aily surveys. 
Their results show that the blended learning method improves 
student achievement levels. Sukhbaatar et al. [6] used decision 
tree to identify dropout prone in the middle of semester. The 
data include d 717 sophomores’ online activities in 
compulsory course. Gabrijela et al. [7] performed association 
analysis in a blended learning environment to improve the 
examination process. They’ve discovered a large number of 
association rules through Apriori algorithm, and their results 
enabled teachers to better understand the concept of creating 
tests and decide how to improve the test design. Bratislav et 
al. [8] conducted a comparative analysis of predictive 
classifiers in a blended learning environment. Using different 
classifiers(Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes, etc.) to obtain 
important results in different categories, and then using the 
majority voting scheme to form an ensemble based on Naive 
Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes, J48 decision tree and Random 
Forest.  
The Fundamentals of Programming offered by Nankai 
University is divided into Fundamentals of Programming 
(Part 1) and Fundamentals of Programming (Part 2), which are 
respectively offered in two semesters in one academic year. 
This course is a public compulsory course , students from 8 
majors including mathematics, chemistry , history, etc. This 
course adopts blended learning mode and the curriculum 
design could be summarized as following:  
 Before class, students watch the teaching videos on 
SPOC (Small Private Online Course) platform ,  
participate in discussions in the discussion board, etc. 
This part is mainly based on students' autonomous 
learning;  
 In class, teachers give quizz es to check the 
effectiveness of students’ self-learning, and explain in-
depth the key points, difficult points, as well as the 
error-prone points discovered from the quizzes;  
 After class, students finish case study assignments ,  
problem solving project, etc.; 
 Final exam accounts for 30% of the total score.  
The research data of this paper is from the two -semester 
course, Fundamentals of Programming.  The participating 
objects, teaching process and evaluation methods of the two 
teaching cycles are consistent, and formative evaluation data 
is collected from each stage of the blended course. 
For most of the research on blended learning, data used to 
do data mining was from  one course of one semester, or 
different courses of multiple semesters. It is rare to study the 
data of one course with two semesters. In two semesters with 
the same teaching process, whether the students’ performance 
tends to be the same or there are obvious differences is what 
we are interested in and worth further study. Therefore, this 
study explored the learning behavior of students by analyzing 
and comparing all the teaching data of a two-semester course.

Prediction
 
1)
 
Feature engineering
 
The purpose of feature selection is to analyze the 
effectiveness of each feature from a theoretical 
perspective 
and select the most representative feature subset with the best 
classification performance to effectively describe the input 
data
, i
t is an important task before building prediction model
. 
In this paper, 
R
andom 
F
orest 
was
 
used to 
sort the featu
re 
importance
.
 
2)
 
Prediction model
 
The maximum number of features in this 
paper
 
is 20. For 
data with lower feature dimensions, feature engineering plus 
traditional machine learning methods will have stronger 
generalization ability, and the results are also more 
interpretable and adjustable. Ensemble learning in machine 
learning is to
 
combine several weak supervised models in 
order to get a better and more comprehensive strong 
supervised model. The underlying idea is that even if one 
weak classifier gets a wrong prediction, other weak classifiers 
can correct the error back. Therefore, 
four kinds of popular 
ensemble learning algorithms are selected in this study to 
establish the final exam grade prediction model. 
 

 
RF(Random Forest). An algorithm that uses multiple 
decision trees to train and predict samples.
 

 
AdaBoost. With the idea of it
eration, only one weak 
classifier is trained in each iteration, and the trained weak 
classifier will participate 
in
 
the next iteration.
 

 
GB(Gradient Boosting). The goal of each weak classifier 
is to fit the negative gradient of the loss function of the 
prev
ious accumulative model, so that the cumulative 
model loss after adding the weak learner can be reduced 
in the direction of the negative gradient.
 

 
XGBoost. It is based on CART tree, with negative gradient 
as the learning strategy.
 
The final exam is the las
t part of the Fundamentals of 
P
rogramming course, and the review time will be reserved for 
the 
students
 
before the exam
.
 
I
n order to give early warning to 
students
 
and 
let
 
them 
adjust the review pace more reasonably
,
 
i
n this paper, students' identity chara
cteristics and 
grades
 
obtained in the course 
were
 
used to predict the final exam 
results of each semester
.

Prediction
 
1)
Feature engineering
 
The purpose of feature selection is to analyze the 
effectiveness of each feature from a theoretical 
perspective 
and select the most representative feature subset with the best 
classification performance to effectively describe the input 
data
, i
t is an important task before building prediction model
. 
In this paper, 
R
andom 
F
orest 
was
used to 
sort the featu
re 
importance
.
 
2)
Prediction model
 
The maximum number of features in this 
paper
is 20. For 
data with lower feature dimensions, feature engineering plus 
traditional machine learning methods will have stronger 
generalization ability, and the results are also more 
interpretable and adjustable. Ensemble learning in machine 
learning is to
combine several weak supervised models in 
order to get a better and more comprehensive strong 
supervised model. The underlying idea is that even if one 
weak classifier gets a wrong prediction, other weak classifiers 
can correct the error back. Therefore, 
four kinds of popular 
ensemble learning algorithms are selected in this study to 
establish the final exam grade prediction model. 
 

RF(Random Forest). An algorithm that uses multiple 
decision trees to train and predict samples.
 

AdaBoost. With the idea of it
eration, only one weak 
classifier is trained in each iteration, and the trained weak 
classifier will participate 
in
the next iteration.
 

GB(Gradient Boosting). The goal of each weak classifier 
is to fit the negative gradient of the loss function of the 
prev
ious accumulative model, so that the cumulative 
model loss after adding the weak learner can be reduced 
in the direction of the negative gradient.
 

XGBoost. It is based on CART tree, with negative gradient 
as the learning strategy.
 
The final exam is the las
t part of the Fundamentals of 
P
rogramming course, and the review time will be reserved for 
the 
students
before the exam
.
I
n order to give early warning to 
students
and 
let
them 
adjust the review pace more reasonably
,
i
n this paper, students' identity chara
cteristics and 
grades
obtained in the course 
were
used to predict the final exam 
results of each semester
.
T
he clustering result
s
of the first 
semester 
were
added into the prediction of the second 
semester as an important feature.

Category 0: Students of this category performed excellent and balanced in all aspects, with no obvious weaknesses. Such students account for 35% of the total number.
Category 1: Students of this category scored lower in two semesters of offline course, and performed excellent in other items. Such students account for 32% of the total number.
Category 2: Students of this category scored lower in two semesters’ final exam, and performed moderate in other items. Such students account for 25% of the total number.
Category 3: Students of this category had poor performance in all aspects, especially in the final exam. Moreover, they scored lower on SPOC platform compared with those of other three categories. Such students account for 8% of the total number.
It can be found that the clustering results in two semesters are basically the same, and when the data of the two semesters were clustered together, the advantages and disadvantages of each category in the two semesters are basically the same. In addition, most students achieved excellent results on the SPOC platform, while the final exam was challenging for many students.
C. The Prediction Model of Final Exam
1) Final exam grade prediction of the first semester
Firstly, a total of 11 features in the first semester performed feature selection using Random Forest. Features include grades of the first semester, students’ identity information and college entrance examination score(qs).
The results of feature importance ranking are shown in Fig. 5.
F represents the first semester.
According to the ranking of feature importance, discarding the last two features, province and SPOC video grades, the best results of final exam grade prediction were obtained by using the remaining 9 features. The algorithms used were Adaboost, Random Forest, Gradient Boost and XGBoost. The model called functions in the scikit-learn (sklearn) module, and the data set was divided into a 70% train set and a 30% test set. The iteration times of the model were 100, 50, 200 and 200 respectively. The prediction results are shown in Table V.
2) Final exam grade prediction of the second semester
The K-Means clustering results of the first semester were known data for the second semester, so added the results to the data set, then Random Forest was used to rank the feature importance degree of 20 features. Except 11 features in the first semester, it also includes clustering results of the first semester(category F) and grades in the second semester.
The results of feature importance ranking are shown in Fig. 6.
S represents the second semester.
By feature selection results, discarding problem solving project grades(F), SPOC exam grades(F), SPOC video grades(F) and province, using the rest of the 16 features to establish the second semester’s final exam grades prediction model got the best effect.
Model parameters and data set partitioning same with the first semester. The prediction results are shown in Table Ⅵ."

The
 
results
 
of 
association
 
analysis
 
show
 
that students who 
actively participate in 
online and offline 
class in the first 
semester will also keep an active attitude of pa
rticipation in 
the second semester. The results
 
of
 
clustering
 
show that for

of students, their relative

among the SPOC platform score

and final exam score
s
 
remain the 
consistent
 
in 
two
 
semesters. Overall, most students’ SPOC platform 
performance 
was
 
outstanding, only 8% of students g
o
t bad 
SPOC platform score
s
, 
but
 
for some students the final exam 
was
 
challenging. The possible reason is that the teaching video 
on
 
SPOC platform c
ould
 
be 
watched repeatedly, the quiz 
was
 
relatively simple
, but
 
t
he final exam 
was
 
a closed
-
book exam, 
which measure
d
 
students' memory and mastery of knowledge. 
Through the above 
association analysis
 
and clustering 
analysis of the Fundamentals of 
P
rogramming cours
e, it can 
be found that under the blended learning mode, most 
students
 
will show similar learning effects in two semesters for 
a 
course with a one
-
year learning cycle.
 
Finally, by combining the characteristics of students' 
identity, 
course
 
grades
 
and clust
ering results, model
s
 
that
 
can 
effectively predict the final exam grade
s
 
were
 
established by 
using machine learning. In the feature 
selection
 
of
 
the first 
semester, the SPOC video
 
was
 
less important, which may be 
because the video can be played repeatedly,
 
even if you do not 
watch it carefully, there 
is
 
still a play record. In the feature 
selection of the second semester, the final exam
 
 
of the first 
semester 
was
 
the most important feature
. It
 
indicates that the 
final exam scores of the two semesters have a certain degree 
of correlation. 
And
 
the problem solving
 
project
, SPOC video 
and SPOC 
exam
 
in the first semester ranked
 
low
 
in the second 
semester
, which may be because these three characteris
tics 
ranked
 
low in the first semester, so they ha
d
 
less impact on the 
final exam grade
s
 
of the second semester. It can be seen from 
the model training that the model accuracy in the second 
semester (80.1%) is significantly higher than that in the first 
sem
ester (77.
6
%).
 
It is mainly because the modeling of the 
second semester use

,
 
the final exam 
grades
 
of the first semester rank

first in importance when 
predicting 
final
 
exam results of the second semester, and 
t
he 
clustering resul
ts of the first semester ha
d
 
an important 
influence on the prediction of the second semester
.
 
In the future, it is necessary to establish and improve the 
prediction and feedback mechanism of the results under the 
blended learning mode, analyze the results 
of students after 
the end of the first semester, provide feedback on the learning 
effect for teachers and students, and remind students to adjust 
their learning strategies as soon as possible. Secondly, it’s 
worth consideration to further strengthen the da
ta collection 
function of SPOC platform, such as the click amount 
recording of each teaching video, which is conducive to more 
detailed teaching data analysis in the future

IV. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

This study explored the characteristics of student achievement in a two-semester blended learning course. Based on the formative evaluation data of the course, Apriori algorithm was used to mine association rules between various grades in two semesters. K-Means algorithm was used to classify students and discuss the performance characteristics of different categories. Finally, machine learning algorithms were used to establish final exam grade prediction models.

The results of association analysis show that students who actively participate in online and offline class in the first semester will also keep an active attitude of participation in the second semester. The results of clustering show that for each category of students, their relative advantages and disadvantages among the SPOC platform scores, offline course scores and final exam scores remain the consistent in two semesters. Overall, most students’ SPOC platform performance was outstanding, only 8% of students got bad SPOC platform scores, but for some students the final exam was challenging. The possible reason is that the teaching video on SPOC platform could be watched repeatedly, the quiz was relatively simple, but the final exam was a closed-book exam, which measured students' memory and mastery of knowledge. Through the above association analysis and clustering analysis of the Fundamentals of Programming course, it can be found that under the blended learning mode, most students will show similar learning effects in two semesters for a course with a one-year learning cycle.

Finally, by combining the characteristics of students' identity, course grades and clustering results, models that can effectively predict the final exam grades were established by using machine learning. In the feature selection of the first semester, the SPOC video was less important, which may be because the video can be played repeatedly, even if you do not watch it carefully, there is still a play record. In the feature selection of the second semester, the final exam of the first semester was the most important feature. It indicates that the final exam scores of the two semesters have a certain degree of correlation. And the problem solving project, SPOC video and SPOC exam in the first semester ranked low in the second semester, which may be because these three characteristics ranked low in the first semester, so they had less impact on the final exam grades of the second semester. It can be seen from the model training that the model accuracy in the second semester (80.1%) is significantly higher than that in the first semester (77.6%).

It is mainly because the modeling of the second semester used two semesters’ features, the final exam grades of the first semester ranked first in importance when predicting final exam results of the second semester, and the clustering results of the first semester had an important influence on the prediction of the second semester.

In the future, it is necessary to establish and improve the prediction and feedback mechanism of the results under the blended learning mode, analyze the results of students after the end of the first semester, provide feedback on the learning effect for teachers and students, and remind students to adjust their learning strategies as soon as possible. Secondly, it’s worth consideration to further strengthen the data collection function of SPOC platform, such as the click amount recording of each teaching video, which is conducive to more detailed teaching data analysis in the future."
