Abstract. The increasing number of students dropping out is a major concern of higher 
educational institutions as it gives a great impact not only cost to the students but also a waste of 
public funds. Thus, it is imperative to understand which students are at risk of dropping out and 
what are the factors that contribute to higher dropout rates. This can be done using educational 
data mining. In this paper, we described the uses of data mining techniques to predict student 
dropout of Computer Science undergraduate students after 3 years of enrolment in Universiti 
Teknologi MARA. The experimental results showed an achievable reliable classification 
accuracy from the selected algorithm in predicting dropouts. Decision tree, logistic regression, 
random forest, K-nearest neighbour and neural network algorithm were compared to propose the 
best model. The results showed that some of the machines learning algorithms are able to 
establish effective predictive models from student retention data. The Logistic Regression model 
was found to be the best learners to predict the dropout students with identified potential subject 
causes. In addition, we also presented some findings related to data exploration. 
1.  Introduction 
Student retention issue at higher institution has gained wide attention and has become an important 
problem to the university administrators to ensure the student gains success or graduate and decrease 
the student’s drop out from the institution. It is important for the university to understand the behaviour 
of successful students. Thus, many studies have been done to understand student failure or drop out 
issue at university level as discussed in [1-3]. Much of the work done has identified the main factors 
that affect the low performance of students such as failure while others focused on the characteristic s 
that influence the students to drop out from university. The seminal work began with Tinto [2] model in 
student retention literature, which explored and explained the causes of students to drop out from the 
university. Among the characteristics of the st udents that can inﬂuence school failure were 
demographics, cultural, social, family, or educational background, socioeconomic status, psychological 
proﬁle, and academic progress [2]. The model suggested that student’s social and academic integration","Predicting Student Drop-Out in Higher Institution Using Data

into the educational institution is the major determinant of completion and the model also identiﬁed 
some key inﬂuences on integration such as the student’s family background, personal characteristics, 
previous schooling, prior academic performance, and interact ions between student and the faculty. 
Bharadawaj and Pal [4 -5] identified factors such as senior secondary exam, annual family income, 
residence and family status as important factors influencing student’s dropout. Meanwhile, other studies 
used enrolment data such as in Kovacic [6], and mother’s education and family income in Devasia et 
al.[7] to predict dropout. Recently, Perez et al.[1] used student demographics and transcripts records 
with courses grade performance to predict student’s dropout. 
Despite t he existence of multiple findings on the factors that have been identified to influence 
student’s dropout in the literature, there is limited research related to student’s dropout from computer 
science area. Thus, there is a need to investigate the causes that lead students from Computer Science 
program to withdraw from the course before its completion. This can be achieved using data mining 
techniques by analyzing and extracting information from existing student data to predict student’s 
dropout. The development of machine learning algorithms of data mining in recent years has enabled a 
large number of successful data mining projects in various applications specifically in educational data 
mining. Considering the factors that influence the dropout rates in universities, the aim of this study is 
to identify the key determinants of undergraduate student dropout rates in Computer Science program 
of Universiti Teknologi MARA and to determine which data mining technique is more suitable to find 
these key determinants. Hence, this paper demonstrates several machine learning algorithms to model 
student dropout using student admission data of 2016 gathered from academic databases. The best 
predictive model can then be used to predict new incoming students of those wh o are most likely to 
benefit from the support of the student retention program.

Data mining is a business process that explores and analyses a large amount of data to extract meaningful 
patterns and rules [7]. This technique of data mining eme rges from a combination field of statistics, 
artificial intelligence and data management that have been successfully applied in various fields such as 
marketing, banking, finance, educational research, fraud detection, and many others. Education is one 
of the domains where the primary concern is the evaluation and, in turn, enhancement of educational 
organizations. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a discipline engaged with the development of 
methods and techniques not only for exploring and analyzing the da ta that come from educational 
context but also for extracting hidden information as to better understand the students. This information 
can be used in several educational processes such as predicting course enrollment, predicting student 
performance, predi cting student dropout rate, detecting a typical value in students’ transcripts, and 
improvement of student models that would predict student’s characteristics or academic performances 
as explained in Tekin [8] and Yukselturk et al. [9]. 
Predicting the dropout of potential students is a workable solution for preventing dropouts. Tinto’s 
model [2] is the most widely accepted model in student retention literature. Tinto concluded that the 
decision of students to persist or drop out of their studies is strongly related to their degree of academic 
and social integration at university. However, Brunsden et al. in [10] tested Tinto model and concluded 
that Tinto’s model may not be the most appropriate for dropout research.  Durso and Cunha [11] did a 
study to identify explanatory factors for undergraduate student’s dropout from Accounting program of 
a Brazilian public university. They used survey database consisted of socioeconomic and demographic 
information of 371 students. The logistic regression model proposed by the study was able to accurately 
predict 77% of the cases dropout/completion from the sample. Five semi -structured interviews with 
those in the sample who dropped out of their studies were done in terms of qualitative study. The findings 
of the research have helped to understand the phenomenon of undergraduate student dropout from 
Accounting program and stresses the importance of rethinking public policies for the retention of talent 
and, especially, of those students who depend on their work to maintain their studies. Kim and Kim [12]

three-year balanced p anel data from 2013 – 2015 and estimated them by using nonlinear panel data 
models. The results showed that cost and burden for student’s financial resources, qualitative and 
quantitative features of faculty, and type/size of the university have significan t effects on university 
dropout. 
There are also several other studies that used data mining approach to predict student’s dropout. Tan 
and Shao [13] used the method of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT) and Bayesian 
Networks (BNs) as a pre diction model, by selecting students’ personal characteristics and academic 
performance as input attributions. The results showed that all the three machine learning methods were 
effective for student’s dropout prediction, but DT presented better performan ce. Meanwhile, Mustafa, 
Chowdhury and Kamal [14] used data mining to develop a dynamic dropout prediction model for 
universities, institutes and colleges. Factors used were gender, financial condition and dropping year to 
classify the successful from unsuc cessful students. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and 
CHAID were used to examine the factors after applying data separation. CART was the most successful 
in growing the tree with an overall percentage of correct classification, then followed by CHAID. 
In another study, Yukselturk, Ozekes and Türel [9] examined the prediction of dropouts through data 
mining approaches in an online program. The variables involved in this study were gender, age, 
education level, previous online experience, occupation, self-efficacy, readiness, prior knowledge, locus 
of control and the dropout status. Four data mining approaches were applied in order to classify 
dropout’s students that included k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB) 
and Neural Network (NN). 10 -fold cross validation was used to train and test all the methods.  The 
detection sensitivities of 3 -NN, DT, NN and NB classifiers were 87%, 79.7%, 76.8% and 73.9% 
respectively. Online technologies, self -efficacy, online learning readiness  and previous online 
experience were found the most important factor in predicting the dropout using Generic Algorithm 
(GA).  Abu-Oda and El-Halees [15] used different data mining approach in examining and predicting 
students’ dropout from a total of 1290 computer science students who graduated from ALAQSA 
University between 2005 and 2011. Different classifiers were used on the data sets such as Decision 
Tree and Naïve Bayes, and they were tested using 10 -fold cross validation. The accuracy of the 
classifiers was 98.14% and 96.89% respectively. In addition, FP -growth algorithm was also used to 
discover hidden relationships between student’s dropout status and enrolment persistence. The results 
showed that mastering ‘digital design’ and ‘algorithm analysis’ courses has a great effect in predicting 
student persistence in the major and decreases student likelihood of dropout. 
Bharadwaj and Pal [4] used EDM to evaluate student performance among 300 students from five 
different colleges who were enrolled in an undergraduate computer course. They employed a Bayesian 
classification scheme of 17 attributes, of which the score in a senior secondary exam, residence, various 
habits, annual family income, and family status were shown to be important parameters for academi c 
performance. In a second study, Bharadwaj and Pal [5] constructed a new data set which included 
student attendance, and test, seminar, and assignment grades in order to predict academic performance. 
A similar study was proposed by Kovacic [6], who applied EDM to identify which enrollment data could 
be used to predict student academic performance. In this study, he used CHAID and CART algorithms 
on a dataset of student enrollment. 
Al-Radaideh et al. [16] analysed student’s academic data (student gender, st udent age, student 
department, high school grade, lecturer degree, lecturer gender, among others) by building a 
classification model using the decision tree method to improve the quality of higher educational system. 
They found that high school grade was the attribute with the highest gain ratio and was considered the 
root node of the decision tree. The Holdout method and the K -Cross-Validation method (k-CV) were 
used to evaluate the model. However, they found that the collected samples and attributes were not 
sufficient to generate a classification model of high quality. Gerben et al. [17] conducted a case study in 
which they used machine learning techniques to predict student success using features extracted from 
student pre-university academic records. Th eir experimental results showed that simple and intuitive 
classifiers such as decision trees gave useful results with accuracies between 75% and 80%. One of their 
findings was that the strongest predictor of success was the grade for the Linear Algebra course, which","three-year balanced p anel data from 2013 – 2015 and estimated them by using nonlinear panel data

was not seen as the decisive course. Despite these studies, it is not clear which data mining algorithms 
are preferable in this context. For example, Luan in [18] built predictors using clustering as means of 
data exploration and classification. In [19], Romero and Ventura presented a survey on EDM where one 
of their findings was that association analysis has become a popular approach. Meanwhile, Aulck et al. 
[20] did a study to model student dropout using the largest known database of higher education attrition 
through 32500 students’ demographic and transcript records at one of the nation’s largest public 
universities. The result showed that several early indicators of student attrition and student dropout can 
be accurately predicted even when predictions are based on a single term of academic transcript data. It 
highlighted the impact of student retention and success using machine learning. Finally, Herzog in [21] 
presented the results of a case study where Bayesian networks and neural networks were outperformed 
by decision tree algorithms on small educational dataset. 
3.  Methodology 
Predictive modelling for binary classification was performed in this study where dropout (0,1) is the 
target variable. The Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mini ng methodology (CRISP -DM) as 
discussed in Chapman et al. [22] was referred to as a basis of data mining methodology conducted to 
solve the student’s dropout issues. This method is useful for planning and solving business problem. 
The process involves 6 phases as described in figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1. Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining Methodology 
 
The first phase involves business understanding in which this study had defined the student’s dropout 
issue in the previous section. The second phase requires understanding the data set, which involves data 
collection and measurement. Next phase is data pr eparation. This includes coding, feature extraction, 
cleaning and loading the data. Then, the modelling phase describes various applications of machine 
learning algorithm to build the predictive model that can predict the target using respective inputs to 
solve business problem. Evaluation phase focuses on assessing the performance of the model built. Final 
phase of deployment would be operationalization of the model using the new data set. The details of

The data were collected from two sources; admission information which included minimum 
demographic information (gender, birth date) and transcript records which included the courses taken 
and the grades for each of them, the academic program and the academ ic cumulative average. This 
research used computer science students entering the university from the first term of 2016 to the second 
term of 2016. The confidentiality of data was preserved by not using any personal data like ID number, 
date of birth, or n ame. This research only focused on the core courses offered by the programme as it 
dominates the study plan which in turn gives great impact to the dropout. Hence, the transcript data were","4. The Data Set

In data preparation phase, we applied pre-processing technique for the collected data to prepare the data 
for mining purposes. The data were cleaned to ensure no missing value and no unwanted values exist in 
the data set. Some irrelevant attributes were also eliminated. Then the data were re-arranged so that the 
student has the following attributes: Dropout, CGPA, Gender and the course grade score student for the 
duration of 2016 - 2018. The target variable, Dropout is coded into two groups: 1 = Dropout and 2=Not 
Dropout (Graduated). Then, we performed a data profiling to obtain descriptive statistics to further 
understand the data. The distribution of dropout students segmenting by gender is displayed in figure 2. 
Comparison of CGPA distribution by dropout can be seen in figure 3. The boxplot in figure 4 indicates 
the average of the dropout students who obtained CGPA between the ranges of 2.33 to 2.81 cumulative 
grade point average. Further investigation on the CGPA se gmenting by dropout status for selected 
courses is displayed in figure 5. As expected, dropout students presented lower grade averages across 
almost all selected subjects. Mathematics and IT courses were the most challenging for the students, 
followed by Computer Science Subject and Management.

6.  Modelling and Evaluation 
Data mining techniques are mostly used to build a model for prediction, classification of data into 
categories or to discover any meaningful hidden pattern and relationships in the observed data. The most 
common methods of classifications are decision tree s, classification rules, probabilistic or Bayesian 
networks, neural networks and hybrid procedures. In this study, we investigated the impact of five 
algorithms: k-NN, Decision Tree, Neural Network, Logistics Regression and Random Forest. 
6.1.  K-NN 
K-NN algorithm classifies objects based on closes training examples in the feature space. The closeness 
is defined in terms of a distance metric called Euclidean distance [23]. Thus, in this study, the students 
are classified by a majority vote of its neighbor with the object being assigned to the class most common 
among its k nearest neighbor’s. The best choice of k depends upon the data.  
6.2 Decision Tree 
The decision tree models trained in this study is an induce binary tree with two minimum number of 
instances in leaves, a split greater than 5, with maximum 100 node levels for depth of classification tree 
and stop splitting the nodes after majority reach 95%. 
6.3 Logistic Regression 
Logistic regression studies the association between dichotomous dependent variables and a set of k 
independent variables in which the independent variables are used to estimate the outcome of the 
dependent variables as discussed in Hosmer, Lemeshow and Sturdivant [23].  The goal of this model is 
to estimate the probability that an event o ccurs, p which is the probability of dropout. In this study, 
maximum likelihood was used to find the best-fit line for logistic regression. 
6.4 Neural Network 
The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained in this study used multilayer perceptron (MLP) model 
with a maximum of 100 allowable hidden layer and maximum iteration of 200.

This study trained the Random Forest model with the following parameters: number of trees in the forest 
= 10, maximal number of considered feature= 5, and unlimited tree depth and stop splitting nodes with 
maximum instances= 5. 
 
To evaluate the classifier, this study performs 10 -times random sampling by splitting the data set into 
training and testing size. Then, the performance measures were calculated. Results produced by  these 
prediction models were compared using classification table in which it provides Classification Accuracy 
(CA), AUC, Precision, Recall and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Chart. The results were 
used for comparison with baseline methods for performance evaluation. 
7.  Results and Discussion 
As suggested based on previous works, models offering the best accuracy include Decision Tree, 
Logistic Regression, k -NN and Artificial Neural Network. In this study, apart from four predictive 
model, we also tr ained Random Forest model as a complemented technique because it is suitable for 
classification and regression. Random Forest operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at 
training time and outputting the class that is the mean prediction of the individual trees.  
We first presented the results of Decision Tree model. The model produced a classification tree of 
13 nodes and 7 leaves (Figure 7).

From the decision tree, we found that:

For logistic regression model, the significant  coefficients are displayed in t able 2. As expect ed, it 
found that five important courses of Discrete Mathematics, Object Oriented Programming, Calculus I 
and Fundamentals of Data Structures had a negative influence on the dropping out factor. Hence, the 
higher the score obtained for these five important courses, the lower the risk of the student dropping out 
from the university.

Finally, table 3 presents the results for the overall performance of five selected predictive models 
algorithms based on Classification Accuracy, Precision and AUC. The achieved results revealed that the 
Logistic regression classifier performed best (with the highest overall classification accuracy) followed 
by k-NN, Random Forest, Neural Network and Decision Tree. All models tested performed with overall 
accuracy above 80% which means the error rate was low and predictions were reliable. The detection 
on the sensitivities of Logistic Regression, k-NN, Random Forest, Neural Network and Decision Tree 
were 89.9%, 87.8%, 85.2%,82.4% and 80.9% respectively.

The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve is also used for the evaluation of classification 
algorithm. The ROC Curve measures the performance of the model by plotting the true positive rates 
against false positive rates. A test with perfect discrimination has ROC plot that passes through the upper 
test corner (100% sensitivity, 100% specificity). According to ROC curve in figure 8, it was found that 
Logistic Regression model is the best classifier as the ROC curve is approaching 1. Hence, the results 
indicated that Logistic Regression performs very well in predicting the dropout students.","Case 3: A computer science student with Discrete Mathematics (MAT210) lower and equal to 3.00, 
Introduction to Database Management Systems (ITS232) of greater than 2.00, Object Oriented 
Programming (CSC238) greater than 2.00, Calculus I (MAT183) greater than 2.33, Inte ractive 
Multimedia (CSC253) lower than 3.33 and Structured Programming (CSC128) lower and equal than 
3.33 has 66.7% chance for dropping out from the university. 
For logistic regression model, the significant  coefficients are displayed in t able 2. As expect ed, it 
found that five important courses of Discrete Mathematics, Object Oriented Programming, Calculus I 
and Fundamentals of Data Structures had a negative influence on the dropping out factor. Hence, the 
higher the score obtained for these five important courses, the lower the risk of the student dropping out 
from the university.

Finally, table 3 presents the results for the overall performance of five selected predictive models 
algorithms based on Classification Accuracy, Precision and AUC. The achieved results revealed that the 
Logistic regression classifier performed best (with the highest overall classification accuracy) followed 
by k-NN, Random Forest, Neural Network and Decision Tree. All models tested performed with overall 
accuracy above 80% which means the error rate was low and predictions were reliable. The detection 
on the sensitivities of Logistic Regression, k-NN, Random Forest, Neural Network and Decision Tree 
were 89.9%, 87.8%, 85.2%,82.4% and 80.9% respectively.

4 Artificial Neural Network 0.838 0.691 
5 Decision Tree 0.812 0.619 
 
 
The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve is also used for the evaluation of classification 
algorithm. The ROC Curve measures the performance of the model by plotting the true positive rates 
against false positive rates. A test with perfect discrimination has ROC plot that passes through the upper 
test corner (100% sensitivity, 100% specificity). According to ROC curve in figure 8, it was found that 
Logistic Regression model is the best classifier as the ROC curve is approaching 1. Hence, the results 
indicated that Logistic Regression performs very well in predicting the dropout students."

8.  Conclusions 
Data mining has played an important role in Educational research.  Applying data mining in this 
domain can help to assess students’ performance, predicting drop out and analyzing student 
performance. In this paper, we have applied five predictive model algorithms on the enrolment student’s 
data to predict the student’s dropout based on predictive accuracy. It has also been indicated that a good 
classifier model has to be both accurate and comprehensible. The r esults indicated that the best 
classification accuracy and AUC was achieved by Logistic regression classifier. It outperformed other 
algorithms compared to k-NN, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree with better 
accuracy and comprehensive classifier. Five important features were necessary to achieve this accuracy 
(Discrete Mathematics, Object Oriented Programming, Calculus I and Fundamentals of Data 
Structures). It implies that these courses have greatest impact in dropout prediction. T he study can be 
further extended for future work by collecting a larger dataset from all campuses and applying the model 
using such data to show how it is generalized to other specific programs. The findings must be shared 
with faculty members to validate and refine the model and implement it for a better productive 
environment.
