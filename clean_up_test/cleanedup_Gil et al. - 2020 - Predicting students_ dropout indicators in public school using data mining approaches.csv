ABSTRACT 
 
Currently, one of the challenges of academic institutions is 
dropout student issues. It is critical to recognize which 
students are at risk of losing in school and what are the 
underlying factors of dropout. The study of students' dropout 
in Lawigan National High School enables teachers to identify 
the influential factors of dropout cases in school preemptively, 
to respond to it immediately, and to assist prospective dropout 
students in continuing studies and gaining knowledge for a 
better future.  Lawigan National High School is a public 
school supervised with the Department of Education. The said 
school holds all the records of the students. The study aims to 
identify the underlying factors of dropout students that need to 
have an intervention to lessen the value of dropouts. The 
Weka Experiment Environment platform  used to run 
simulations with machine learning algorithms from ready 
datasets. Two classification algorithms C4.5 and Naïve Bayes 
(NB) tested on a dataset containing student academic and  
demographic details, e.g., age, gender, marital status, written, 
performance, and quarterly examination grade, attendance 
percentage, home distance, parents ' income, mothers ' 
education, fathers ' education, and dropout status, using a 
10-fold cross-validation to estimate generalization accuracy. 
The experiment result shows that the top indicator for 
students' dropout cases is the academic performance with 
98.9474% accuracy as perceived by the C4.5 algorithm , as 
shown in Table 2.

education encounter today is predicting student performance. 
The school would like to know more about the performance of 
the student organization. He introduced a trial to examine 
student performance when an extensive student information 
system database (SIS) given. Generally, the problems of 
students categorized into different patterns based on the level 
of students as normal, average, and below average. In this 
subject, an effort  made to analyze the SIS database using a 
rough set of theories to predict the future of students.  
Gole et al. [6] suggested the implementation of Educational 
Data Mining (EDM) to predict dropout or cance llation of 
engineering admissions. The comparative study of techniques 
and their results is, therefore, studied to analyze the graph of 
such students and to identify model characteristics for further 
use. It would consider whether these admissions could be 
predicted and determined at the time of admission or after one 
or two years. Here, in this paper, they are trying to form a 
model in which its characteristics would tell about students 
who are likely to leave engineering education. This model will 
develop using Educational Data Mining and the tools and 
techniques involved with it. 
Sunbok Lee and Jae Young Chung [4] introduced a study 
aimed at improving the efficiency of the early warning 
system: (a) dealing with the problem of class imbalance using 
synthetic minority oversampling techniques (SMOTE) and 
set-up approaches in machine learning; and (b) testing 
qualified classifiers with both receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) and precision -recall (PR) cu rves. 
Towards this purpose, they trained random forest, improved 
decision tree, random forest with SMOTE, and upgraded 
decision tree with SMOTE using huge data samples from 
165,715 high school students from the National Education 
Information System (NEIS) in South Korea. 
Nindhia Hutagaol [3] designed a system to find the best 
modeling approach for the identification of dropout student 
predictors from 17,432 private university student data in 
Jakarta. They also evaluate d and calculated the association 
between demographic variables and academic performance to 
predict student dropout using three single classifiers: 
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Decision 
Tree (DT). They considered indicators such as student 
attendance, homework, mid -test grade, final grade, overall 
credit, GPA, student location, parent income, parent education 
level, gender, and age as student dropout predictors. 
Shubhangi Urkude and Kshitij Gupta [5] developed this 
study to predict the students' performances in the examination 
and also to predict whether or not the student will graduate. 
For this reason, they are using a statistical analytical 
technique, which is the F1 score. The F1 score or the F 
measure used to measure the accuracy of the prediction by 
taking into account the accuracy and recall of the score. The 
dataset used in this study contains 395 student records with 
attributes such as age, health, internet, school, father's job, 
mother's job, etc. Utilizing support vector machines (SVM), 
Decision Tree, and Naïve Bayes (N B) classification 
algorithms, the score of F1  determined for each algorithm. 
Based on the analysis, the F1 help vector machine score gives 
a better prediction compared to the rest of the two algorithms. 
A. Cano and H. M. Fardoun [6] suggested a technique and a 
basic classification algorithm discover clear and 
understandable models of student dropout prediction as soon 
as possible. They have carried out several experiments to 
predict dropout at different stages of the course, to select the 
best dropout indic ators, and to compare the proposed 
algorithm with some well -known classical and unbalanced 
classification algorithms. Results show ed that the algorithm 
was able to accurately predict student dropout during the first 
four-six weeks of the program and was efficient enough to be 
used in the early warning system. 
3. METHODOLOGY 
The focus of this research is to predict the indicators of 
students' dropout using data mining approaches. In this 
section, t he phases of this analysis are fourfold to come up 
with the predicted dropout indicators; data gathering, data 
preprocessing, applying the data mining algorithm, and 
analyzing the result, as shown in Figure 1. That data collected

3. 3 Applying Data Mining Algorithm 
The school has issues determining the variables that affect 
dropout events. While, by predicting the dropout factors, it 
can improve the performance of the school and help the 
academic system by giving early warning to students, by 
using a classification technique [7].  
A. Hussain, et al. [8] claimed that the aim of data mining is 
to obtain relationships or trends that may provide useful 
information. Additionally, they argued that data mining is a 
process of getting significant relationships, patterns, and 
trends by analyzing a large number of stored data, using 
pattern recognition techniques such as statistical and 
mathematical techniques. One of the machine learning 
techniques is a classification algorithm, a learning technique 
used to predict the value of the target variables. 
3.3.1 Decision Tree Classifier 
J48 is an open -source JAVA implementation of the C4.5 
algorithm in WEKA. C4.5 is a decision tree algorithm. The 
J48 Decision tree classifier uses a genetic algorithm [6]. When 
classifying a new item, it  generates a decision tree that is 
based on the values of the attributes available in the training 
data. Therefore, whenever a new training set is identified, it 
defines the parameter that distinguishes the various instances 
with the utmost clarity. This m eans that these attributes are 
established which deliver optimal information and are used 
for better classification. This process takes place until all 
attributes with the highest to the lowest gain of knowledge are 
identified using the  tree diagram.  In t his manner, the last 
classified attribute will bring us the result of the J48 technique 
prediction. Cross-validation of the dataset is also carried out 
to check if the result is correct. This is done by considering the 
ten-fold cross-validation training set. 
 
3.3.2 Naive Bayes Classifier  
Naïve Bayes Classifier is a classification based on Bayes 
Theorem, which assumes independent predictors. The 
classifier implies that if a particular feature found in a class, 
not linked to the existence of any other feature. The Naïve 
Bayes Classifier based on a simple definition. It utilizes 
variables separately included in the data sample by analyzing 
each of them. The Naïve Bayes classifier depends on the 
conditional probability obtained from the Bayes Law [9]. It 
utilizes all the variables included in the data, and then allows 
an individual analysis as they are equally important and 
independent of each other. 
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this analysis, the classification of dropout students was 
undertaken using da ta mining models based on C4.5 and 
Naive Bayes. 10-fold cross validation has been performed to 
verify each classifier. After performing the ten tests , the 
average test output was used to assess the accuracy of the 
model created. 
Firstly, the authors do the  data-cleaning process, such as 
resolving missing values in the dataset and facilitating 
datasets with the correct attributes. In this instance, four cells 
of under ""student attendance"" variable and five cells under 
""quarterly examination grade"" variable having no value which 
are not related to the other variables have been excluded from 
the dataset. Next, the authors checked the standardization or 
distribution of data to determine whether the distribution of 
data was normal or balanced, and to minimize the  effects of 
prediction errors during the modeling process. In addition, the 
impute value technique was implemented to fill missing value 
in the parents' income variable with its mean values in order to 
mitigate bias in the dataset. Lastly, the authors have 150 data 
with 12 variables as parameter inputs from the data cleaning","extracting missing values, smoothing noise data, selecting the 
correct attribute from the database or eliminating irrelevant 
attributes, finding or removing external values from the 
dataset, and resolving data inconsistencies. 
Some of the insignificant parameters have been removed 
from the database, such as student ID n umber and student 
name. A total of  12 variables correlated with student 
demographics and academic performance data have been 
listed from the dataset. The indexed variables in the database 
are in Table 1.

information. Additionally, they argued that data mining is a 
process of getting significant relationships, patterns, and 
trends by analyzing a large number of stored data, using 
pattern recognition techniques such as statistical and 
mathematical techniques. One of the machine learning 
techniques is a classification algorithm, a learning technique 
used to predict the value of the target variables. 
3.3.1 Decision Tree Classifier 
J48 is an open -source JAVA implementation of the C4.5 
algorithm in WEKA. C4.5 is a decision tree algorithm. The 
J48 Decision tree classifier uses a genetic algorithm . When 
classifying a new item, it  generates a decision tree that is 
based on the values of the attributes available in the training 
data. Therefore, whenever a new training set is identified, it 
defines the parameter that distinguishes the various instances 
with the utmost clarity. This m eans that these attributes are 
established which deliver optimal information and are used 
for better classification. This process takes place until all 
attributes with the highest to the lowest gain of knowledge are 
identified using the  tree diagram.  In t his manner, the last 
classified attribute will bring us the result of the J48 technique 
prediction. Cross-validation of the dataset is also carried out 
to check if the result is correct. This is done by considering the 
ten-fold cross-validation training set. 
 
3.3.2 Naive Bayes Classifier  
Naïve Bayes Classifier is a classification based on Bayes 
Theorem, which assumes independent predictors. The 
classifier implies that if a particular feature found in a class, 
not linked to the existence of any other feature. The Naïve 
Bayes Classifier based on a simple definition. It utilizes 
variables separately included in the data sample by analyzing 
each of them. The Naïve Bayes classifier depends on the 
conditional probability obtained from the Bayes Law . It 
utilizes all the variables included in the data, and then allows 
an individual analysis as they are equally important and 
independent of each other. 
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this analysis, the classification of dropout students was 
undertaken using da ta mining models based on C4.5 and 
Naive Bayes. 10-fold cross validation has been performed to 
verify each classifier. After performing the ten tests , the 
average test output was used to assess the accuracy of the 
model created. 
Firstly, the authors do the  data-cleaning process, such as 
resolving missing values in the dataset and facilitating 
datasets with the correct attributes. In this instance, four cells 
of under ""student attendance"" variable and five cells under 
""quarterly examination grade"" variable having no value which 
are not related to the other variables have been excluded from 
the dataset. Next, the authors checked the standardization or 
distribution of data to determine whether the distribution of 
data was normal or balanced, and to minimize the  effects of 
prediction errors during the modeling process. In addition, the 
impute value technique was implemented to fill missing value 
in the parents' income variable with its mean values in order to 
mitigate bias in the dataset. Lastly, the authors have 150 data 
with 12 variables as parameter inputs from the data cleaning"

process. 
Based on the data, 57.33% of the student data was led by 
women, while men were only 42.67% of the total data. A 
percentage of 44.67 of student comes from three kilometers 
below from students ' residence to school, 47.33% for 
three-five kilometers, and 8% for five kilometers above 
distance, which means that many of the students come from 
3-5 kilometers away from school. In relation, 72% of students 
are mostly 16-17 years of age, followed by 15 years of age and 
below with 18.67% and 9.33 % for the students with18 years 
of age and above. The dataset also showed that 100% of 
students are single. The majority of mother's and father's 
educational attainment was ""high school"" and ""elementary"" 
level. The parent's financial income is mostly 5,000 to 10,000 
a month. These data metrics, in demographic features, identify 
that the dataset has a relatively good variation to be used in the 
student dropout indicators prediction.  Utilizing 150 inp ut 
data, the authors observed, compared , and examined the 
efficiency of two different common classifiers, C4.5 , and 
Naïve Bayes, as shown in Table 2 and Table 3.

Through a series of tests, the authors identified that the key 
attributes that affect student dropouts are mostly academic 
aspects, namely performance grade, quarterly exam rating, 
attendance percentage, and written score (e.g. , quizzes, 
summative test). Such results are similar to the past data of 
Pereira and Zambrano [4], wherein the primary causes of 
student dropout attributed to the academic v ariables such as 
low academic grade.  Also, the location or distance of the 
school from the students ' residences has related factors of 
students' dropout. A similar study by Rahman and Dash, who 
have foun d out that the location of a student's residence, 
whether rural or urban, has been related to the attributes of 
dropout [5]. Moreover, the parent's income has also played a 
huge impact that affects the students' dropout , as shown in

that the key attributes that profoundly affect student dropouts 
are in academic performance.  
For future studies, researchers need to conduct research to 
synthesize and extrapolate meaningful knowledge from 
student data through data mining actions. The key limitations 
of this research were based only on a single experiment and a 
small sample of students. Many researchers can replicate this 
type of study with larger sets of student data from many 
schools. Additional studies may also include adjusting and 
adding variables, implementing certain algorithms, and 
altering preprocessing methods. Moreover, data collection 
from the qualitative data methodology (i.e., interviewing 
students' dropouts) may enable researchers to evaluate and 
analyze the data through the data mining technique by 
viewing a multifaceted picture of what happened. Also, these 
types of research could extend to other fields to achieve the 
greatest possible accuracy of predictions.
