Abstract
Ongoing digital transformations facilitate the conduct of online courses and distance
learning. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the role of learners ’ personalities and
behaviors in their academic success (exam scores) in a blended learning setting
(combination of distance learning and face-to-face learning). Next to individual differ-
ences in several variables (including intelligence), participants ’ (n = 62) learning time
and learning motivation over 14 weeks (one term) using questionnaires for one learning
module at the Swiss Distance University Institute was measured. Also, data on the
participants’ grades at the end of the course and the number of exercises they completed
during the term were obtained. A stepwise regression analysis revealed that studying at
the optimal time of the day and studying regularly are relevant predictors of academic
success. The results and limitations of the study are discussed in the context of
academic success prediction in higher education.

Academic success plays a crucial role in an individual ’s life and is of great societal

institutional performance (Alyahyan and Dü ştegör 2020; Strenze 2007; Vermeulen and

online courses and distance learning. Furthermore, the current situation related to"
2021 - The advantage of distributed practice in a blended learning setting.pdf,"COVID-19 pandemic containment measures, including home confinement, social
distancing, suspension of gatherings, and closing of schools, has exponentially in-
creased the use of online courses and distance learning (Dietrich et al. 2020). It is
predicted that there will be an even stronger uptick in interest in these learning
modalities in the future. Academic success is a widely studied concept, but many
studies that focus on the predicting variables of academic success have been tested in
traditional learning settings without measuring actual behavioral pattern (Chamorro-
Premuzic and Furnham 2003; Giofrè et al. 2017; Kappe and van der Flier 2012;
Lounsbury et al. 2003; Stadtfeld et al. 2019). In the current digital era, it is an
indispensable step to identify learners ’ behaviors that relate to academic success in a
blended learning setting.
Blended learning is an approach used in distance learning and combines online
modes of learning (e.g., podcasts, materials and activities delivered online via learning
platform systems) and offline modes of learning (e.g., face-to-face sessions at a given
time in a physical classroom) (Bonk and Graham 2006). Online learning (compared
with offline learning) is characterized by an individualization of learning, including
aspects such as autonomy, flexibility, and use of multiple information and communi-
cation technologies (Lust et al. 2013). In a distance learning environment, students are
more flexible and can therefore more strongly regulate their way of learning. For
example, students can more easily adjust their study schedule to their needs, enabling
them to distribute their learning over time more evenly instead of limiting it only to the
period before an exam, and they can study at the time of the day that is optimal for
them.
2 Literature review
Since the studies of Ebbinghaus (1885/ 1964; for a review, see, e.g., Donovan and
Radosevich 1999;G r e e n e1989;T o p p i n oa n dB l o o m2002), the beneficial effect of
distributed practice – which implies a more spaced-out method of learning, with time
intervals between study sessions – has largely been acknowledged. Indeed, distributed
practice is one of the most powerful learner behaviors that positively impact academic
success. It is also one of the most researched learner behaviors that has been replicated
in experimental settings (Cepeda et al. 2006; Janiszewski et al. 2003) and applied
settings (Cepeda et al. 2008; Kornell et al. 2010) alike. Current empirical evidence
comes from learning analytics and data mining approaches, which highlight the
importance of self-regulated learning (Tabibian et al. 2019;V i b e r ge ta l .2020). Profiles
of learners who study more regularly by following the sequential structure of a course,
have been shown to gain a deeper understanding of the course materials (Maldonado-
Mahauad et al. 2018). Interestingly, Carvalho et al. ( 2020)s h o w e dt h a tl e a r n e r sw i t h
higher cognitive abilities as well as learners that engage more with the course were
more likely to distribute their learning. However, it is the learners with lower abilities as
well as learners that engaged less with the course that benefitted most from distributed
practice (Carvalho et al. 2020). Further, several studies suggest that morning-type
individuals are more successful with regard to academic achievement (Be şoluk et al.
2011; Preckel et al. 2013). By contrast, there are no significant differences between
morning- and evening-type students in a distance learning setting (Horzum et al. 2014),

2021 - The advantage of distributed practice in a blended learning setting.pdf,"suggesting that online learning can be used to reduce the asynchrony problem faced in
traditional learning settings (e.g., evening-type students having to attend lectures during
mornings and afternoons). Other indicators of learning behavior have been shown to
predict academic success, such as the number of hours of studying (see, e.g., Barbarick
and Ippolito 2003).
Next to learners ’ behaviors, learners’ intelligence and personality have been inves-
tigated. Previous research has strongly focused on the relationship between intelligence
and academic success (e.g., Deary et al. 2007;T o u r o n 1983; Walberg 1984) and
cognitive abilities have been identified as the most important and fundamental factor
of academic success (Rohde and Thompson 2007). To a lesser extent, there have been
efforts to investigate the impact of non-performance-based personality constructs on
academic success, such as the impact of the Big Five personality dimensions (e.g.,
Trapmann et al. 2007), anxiety (Silva et al. 2007), self-control (Zhu et al. 2016)o r
confidence-related constructs, such as self-esteem (Giofrè et al. 2017). These constructs
have been shown to affect academic success and thus to be theoretically relevant.
3 Aim of the study, objectives, and contribution to knowledge
Several learners’ characteristics have been shown to impact academic success. Given
that blended learning is linked to behavioral flexibility, productive learners’behaviors
need to be characterized and their learning practices need investigation in the context of
a blended learning setting, by taking into account the influence of personality variables.
Existing studies are frequently carried out in traditional learning settings and focus on
selected variables, thus neglecting a comprehensive investigation of individual differ-
ences in both learners ’ personalities and behaviors as predictive variables of academic
success beyond intelligence. The main aim of the present study was to assess the most
influential predicting variables for academic success in the context of a blended
learning setting in higher education.
1 We were especially interested in whether distrib-
uted practice would show a substantial advantageous effect on academic success in the
context of a blended learning setting. Moreover, we were interested in testing whether
learning at the optimal time of the day (on-peak: morning for morning types and
evening for evening types) versus learning at the non-optimal time of the day (off-
peak: evening for morning types and morning for evening types) affects academic
success in a distance learning scenario. Based on Horzum et al. ( 2014), we hypothe-
sized that the degree of on-peak learning is positively correlated with academic success.
To assess learners’behaviors, the total number of hours of studying, the time of the day
devoted to studying, and the regularity of studying were collected. Next to learning
practices a further important construct that has been shown to contribute to academic
success is learners ’ motivation and engagement with learning (Cho and Heron 2015;
Lee et al. 2019). Therefore, the weekly motivation was also assessed and a positive
correlation between motivation and academic success was hypothesized.
1 This study was pre-registered (https://aspredicted.org/4kw2a.pdf). Contrary to our pre-registration, we tested
the hypotheses in one learning module and did not attempt to replicate the results across modules with
different learning contents. We address this point in the limitation section of the discussion.

ing the important role of intelligence shown in previous studies (e.g., Tias et al.2015), also
intelligence was measured. Asdependent variablethe points obtained at the final exam of

essential to consider these different aspects of learners simultaneously. The findings have

4 Methods
4.1 Participants
An a priori G*Power analysis revealed that we needed a sample of 40 participants to detect
at least a medium effect (linear multiple regre ssion, fixed model, single regression coeffi-
cient, input parameters:f2 =. 3 5 ,α= 0.05, 1−β=. 9 5 ;F a u le ta l .2007). The estimation of the
expected effect size was based on a previously observed strong positive relation between the
number of exercises that students completed during one term and their exam scores
(unpublished data observed during three previous terms,r(84) = .514, p < .001). The final
sample consisted of 62 university students ( M
age = 36.56, SDage = 7.91; 79.03% female)
enrolled in a statistical psychology course at the Swiss Distance University Institute (autumn
term 2018 and spring term 2019). They were studying psychology at the Swiss Distance
University Institute, and their occupations wereclassified as technicians (3.23%), sales staff
(4.84%), executives (9.68%), social and health services staff (16.13%), teaching (17.74%),
service sector staff (27.42%), and others (e.g., parenthood, professional sportsperson)
(20.97%). The participants reported havi ng an employment rate ranging from 0% to
100% (M = 62.90, SD = 33.70), and 40.32% of the participants reported having at least
one child. Moreover, their highest level of education was assessed, and 59.68% of the
participants reported having another university degree.
All students enrolled in the course ( N = 101) were contacted and had to take part in
the study (but were free to choose whether we could use the data for scientific
purposes). As the course was about methods and statistics, this was a good opportunity
for the students to gain insights into research methods. We discussed one topic of the
course (i.e., multiple linear regression) with a simulated dataset containing the exact
variables we assessed. Out of the 101 students, 25 de-registered from the course early
and thus did not fully participate in the study, 11 did not agree to the use of their data
for scientific purposes, 2 had to be excluded because they displayed clear outlier values
on the dependent variable (based on deleted studentized residuals

approved by the university ’s local ethics committee and was carried out in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975. All person gave their written informed
consent prior to their inclusion in the study.
4.2 Design, procedure, and materials
The study was conducted during a second-term course on statistics (two times: autumn
2018 and spring 2019); the instructor for the course was the last author of this paper.
The course was given in a blended learning setting. In the first week of the online
course, the first meeting took place, in which the students were informed about the
study procedure. Those students who did not attend this session received the informa-
tion via email. We asked the students to fill out a questionnaire assessing different
aspects of their personality (including an intelligence test). They were contacted each
week (over 14 weeks) to report their motivation and learning time and the resources
they invested in for the course. The study design is depicted in Fig. 1.
Learning materials and course requirements Learning materials were presented online in
the web-based Moodle platform (moodle.org). The course contained learning materials for
14 weeks. For each week, a statistical theme was treated (e.g., analysis of variance). The
students had access to a script (summary of recommended book chapters) and a series of
exercises. To encourage distributed learning, we provided five series of exercises that were
obligatory for the students to be able to register for the exam. At the end of each week, all
students received the solution of the weekly exercises, and those who submitted their
solution received detailed feedback from a teaching assistant.
Five meetings with the students took place during the semester (every three weeks).
They had to attend three out of the five meetings in order to register for the exam. The
final exam was the only graded coursework that the students had to pass. This exam,
which was held at the end of the term, took place in a room on campus under the
supervision of a teaching assistant. The students had two hours to work on the exam
(open questions), and the maximum number of possible points was 50.
Questionnaires assessing personality and intelligence Individual differences in the
selected variables were recorded using a questionnaire. All questionnaires were admin-
istered on a computer or mobile device (online questionnaires using the software
Unipark, https://www.unipark.de/. After giving or withdrawing their consent to use
their collected data for research purposes, the participants worked on five personality
questionnaires, which were presented in randomized order, followed by an intelligence
test. Finally, the participants provided their demographic information (age, sex, highest
level of education, employment, number of children). Higher overall scores on all the
questionnaires indicate higher values of the respective variable.
Neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, extraversion,a n d conscientiousness were
assessed with the 15-item Big Five Inventory-SOEP (BFI-S; Schupp and Gerlitz
2014). We used Schupp and Gerlitz short form of the Big Five Personality
Inventory-SOEP to assess the relation between academic success and personality.

(e.g., “I am someone who worries a lot ”), openness (e.g., “Ia ms o m e o n ew h oi s"
2021 - The advantage of distributed practice in a blended learning setting.pdf,"original and brings new ideas ”), agreeableness (e.g., “I am someone who can forgive ”),
extraversion (e.g., “I am someone who is communicative and talkative ”), and consci-
entiousness (e.g., “I am someone who works thoroughly ”). The scale consists of 15
items. Its reliability, validity, and dimensionality have been confirmed (Schupp and
Gerlitz 2014). The participants answered on seven-point Likert-type scales (1 =
disagree strongly to 7 = agree strongly). The mean score for each participant for each
dimension was computed. Internal consistency of each dimension was sufficient.
Cronbach’s alphas were .82 (neuroticism), .75 (openness), .48 (agreeableness), .85
(extraversion), and .61 (conscientiousness).
The German multidimensional Self-Esteem Scale (MSWS; Schütz and Sellin 2006)
consists of six subscales. To assess a possible relationship between self-esteem and academic
success, we used the four subscales of ESWS (emotional self-esteem), SWKO (social self-
esteem regarding security in contact), SWKR (social self-esteem while dealing with criti-
cism), and LSWS (performance-related self-esteem). We did not include the subscales
SWPA and SWSP, which measure self-esteem related to physical features. The MSWS
has good psychometric properties with retest reliabilities for the four subscales used in the
present study ranging from .76 to .87 and Cronbach ’s alphas ranging from .69 to .82
(Schütz et al.2017). General self-esteem was thus assessed with the selected four subscales
consisting of 22 items in total (e.g.,“Do you doubt yourself?”) rated on seven-point Likert-
type scales (1 = not at all to 7 = very much). A mean response score for self-esteem was
computed for each participant. Cronbach’sa l p h aw a s. 8 8 .
The participants also worked on the German short version of the Self-ControlScale
(SCS-K-D; Bertrams and Dickhäuser2009). The SCS-K-D measures individuals’ general
ability to regulate themselves. The SCS-K-D consists of 13 items (e.g., “I am good at

The State-Trait-Anxiety-Depression-Inventory (STADI; Laux et al. 2013;R e n n e r

trait and state aspects. We focused on trait anxiety by using the two sub-scales,
Nervousness and Concern, each including five items (e.g., “My nerves are tense, ”“ I
worry about problems that could come up ”). Latent trait modelling showed that the
STADI is able to differentiate between state and trait anxiety, which was ideal given
our interest in personality characteristics and thus in the trait aspect of anxiety (Laux

extraversion (e.g., “I am someone who is communicative and talkative ”), and conscientiousness (e.g., “I am someone who works thoroughly ”). The scale consists of 15
items. Its reliability, validity, and dimensionality have been confirmed (Schupp and
Gerlitz 2014). The participants answered on seven-point Likert-type scales (1 =
disagree strongly to 7 = agree strongly). The mean score for each participant for each
dimension was computed. Internal consistency of each dimension was sufficient.
Cronbach’s alphas were .82 (neuroticism), .75 (openness), .48 (agreeableness), .85
(extraversion), and .61 (conscientiousness).
The German multidimensional Self-Esteem Scale (MSWS; Schütz and Sellin 2006)
consists of six subscales. To assess a possible relationship between self-esteem and academic
success, we used the four subscales of ESWS (emotional self-esteem), SWKO (social self-
esteem regarding security in contact), SWKR (social self-esteem while dealing with criti-
cism), and LSWS (performance-related self-esteem). We did not include the subscales
SWPA and SWSP, which measure self-esteem related to physical features. The MSWS
has good psychometric properties with retest reliabilities for the four subscales used in the
present study ranging from .76 to .87 and Cronbach ’s alphas ranging from .69 to .82
(Schütz et al.2017). General self-esteem was thus assessed with the selected four subscales
consisting of 22 items in total (e.g.,“Do you doubt yourself?”) rated on seven-point Likert-
type scales (1 = not at all to 7 = very much). A mean response score for self-esteem was
computed for each participant.
The participants also worked on the German short version of the Self-ControlScale
(SCS-K-D; Bertrams and Dickhäuser2009). The SCS-K-D measures individuals’ general
ability to regulate themselves. The SCS-K-D consists of 13 items (e.g., “I am good at
resisting temptations”), which are answered on five-point Likert-type scales (1 =not at all to
5= very much). The SCS-K-D is an established instrument that has been used in various
contexts (e.g., education, sports, experimental psychology). A mean response score for self-
control was computed for each participant.

Cronbach’s alphas ranging from .81 to .86 (Laux et al. 2013). Answers were given
on four-point Likert-type scales (1 = almost never to 4 = almost always ). A mean
response score for anxiety was computed for each participant. Cronbach ’s alpha was
.85.
The German Morningness-Eveningness-Questionnaire (D-MEQ gives indications about
the chronotypeof a person. The MEQ provides an economic yet valid way to measure an
individual’s chronotype. The questionnaire was validated by correlating its results with the
daily lowest bodily temperature of the subjects and the daily onset of melatonin production
and found highly significant correlations. Retest reliabilities of the D-MEQ lie over .95
(Griefahn et al. 2001). The D-MEQ consists of 19 items with single-choice answers (e.g.,
“At approximately what time of the day do you usually feel your best?”). A mean response
score for the sole dimension was computed for each participant.
After the personality questionnaires were administered in random order, the participants
completed the Culture Fair Test-Revised (CFT 20-R; Weiss2006). The CFT 20-R measures
fluid intelligencewith the subtests Series Continuation, Classification, Matrices, and Topo-
logical Conclusions.Crystal intelligencewas measured with two additional tests (Vocabu-
lary and Numerical Sequence). The CFT 20-R is generally considered a valid culture fair test
that has been widely used in studies predicting academic success, especially when predicting
mathematical abilities; correlations between CFT 20-R scores and math grades have been
shown to be higher than correlations between the test scores and for example language
grades (Weiss2006). The CFT-20-R has good psychometric properties with retest reliabil-
ities ranging from .80 to .90 (Weiss 2006). A mean response IQ score was computed for
each participant. Cronbach’s alpha was .56.
Weekly short questionnaire The students were contacted each week (over 14 weeks) to
report their motivation and learning time for the course. Weekly motivation was
measured with four questions on intrinsic motivation ( “This week, I am studying
because I find the topic very interesting ”), extrinsic motivation ( “This week, I am
studying because I want to pass the exam ”), self-efficacy ( “This week, I can remain
calm when facing learning difficulties because I can rely on my abilities ”), and situa-
tional stress (“This week, I have worries and duties other than studying ”), rated on five-
point Likert-type scales (1 = totally true to 5 = not at all true ). The students also
indicated the time (hours) they spent studying and/or working for the course during the
week (morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and night for each day of the week). We
assessed the time of the day the students studied to investigate the impact of studying at
the optimal time of the day (see the on-peak time variable below). The students also
reported the consulted resources, such as course materials (e.g., slides [39.87%], online
platforms [25.92%], supplementary exercises [13.40%], and other resources, examples
of which are online resources, such as YouTube [4.00%], learning materials, such as
textbooks [2.87%], peer-to-peer discussions [1.65%], lectures [0.16%], none [5.42%],
forums [4.25%], and contact with lecturers [2.98%]). Lastly, students who were not
motivated were asked to give a reason and choose between the following options: no
time or other obligations (83.25%), no motivation to study (4.71%), and other reasons
with an open answer (illness [8.90%], technical difficulties [2.09%], and subject diffi-
culty [1.05%]).

The main purpose of the study was to investigate the role of learners ’ personalities and
behaviors in their academic success (exam score) in a blended learning setting. We
report the descriptive statistics and a stepwise regression analysis with exam scores as
the dependent variable. Given the explorative nature of our study, the large number of
variables assessed, and the relatively small sample size, we decided to conduct a
stepwise regression analysis. More details about this analysis are reported below. All
computations in the analyses used jamovi (The Jamovi Project, 2019) and R (R core
Team 2019). The main analyses were conducted with the functionalities of the MASS
(Venables and Ripley 1994) and MICE (van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011)
packages. The R code to reproduce the main analysis is available on OSF ( https://osf.io/
wn2tp/). The datasets that support the findings of this study are not publicly available
due to privacy concerns (the information could compromise the privacy of the
participating students, see variables such as gender, age, exam score, and intelligence
score). The datasets are available from the corresponding author (C.S.M.) on
reasonable request.
5.1 Prediction of exam scores with learners ’ personality and behavior variables
Handling missing data Exploration of the data revealed 8.06% of missing values on the
dependent variable as well as on the number of exercises completed in one term.
Additionally, one missing value on the variable self-control was identified. The other
variables showed no missing values. As 8.06% of values were missing and it has been
suggested to impute variables instead of using listwise deletion when variables have
more than 5% missing values (Azur et al. 2011), we used multivariate imputation by
chained equations (MICE) following the general recommendations of Azur et al.
(2011) (for an overview of the different methods to handle missing data, see, e.g.,
Horton and Kleinman 2007). The MICE procedure included four general steps. First, a
mean imputation was computed for every missing variable. After the mean imputed
values of one variable were set back to the missing values, these missing values were
estimated using multiple regression; every other variable in the dataset was used as a
predictor. The estimations of the mean values that were previously missing were used
as real values for the estimation of missing values on other variables. These steps were
performed for both variables with missing values, which, in turn, constituted one
iteration cycle. Ten iteration cycles were performed; the imputations were updated
each cycle (Azur et al. 2011).

variable hours studied represents the total amount of time that the students invested in
the course, including studying and completing exercises. The variable on-peak time

approach of the D-MEQ population distribution and coded students either as morning
types (values > 50) or evening types. As there were many students with scores between

types of people. Which one of these types do you consider yourself to be? ”), in which
students were asked whether they would label themselves as a morning or evening type
of person. Of the students, 83.87% classified themselves consistent with our classifi-
cation (for a validation of this method, see also Rothen and Meier 2016). We then
calculated the mean percentage (across all study days) of time the students spent
studying in the morning and noon or in the evening and night for the morning and
evening types, respectively.
Number of days is the total number of days that the students spent at least 30 min
studying or completing exercises. Studying regularity is a measure for quantifying the
regularity of studying behavior. We computed the standard deviation of daily study
time for each student. Students with low values on this variable tend to study more
regularly. However, we did not include the days on which the students did not study
because we wanted to consider the number of days separately (see above). Even though
studying regularity, hours studied, and number of days are all indicators of massed
versus distributed learning behavior, it is important to note that one cannot interpret
them separately with respect to the distribution of learning behavior.

and the descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1. All scales showed sufficient
internal consistency; skewness and kurtosis were small. All correlations are reported
in Appendix A.
Visual inspection After visual inspection of the data, anxiety and total hours studied
showed polynomial quadratic relationships with the dependent variable (see Appendix
Fig. 3 for an illustration of the data). Thus, quadratic terms were included in the main
analysis. All other variables showed linear trends or no recognizable pattern (see
Appendix Fig. 3).
Main analysis Given our exploratory approach and small students –predictor ratio, we
conducted a stepwise regression analysis to identify all relevant predictors of academic
success. All variables shown in Table 2, as well as gender and age, were entered into
the initial model. One major concern with stepwise regression techniques and specif-
ically with the present data is the risk of overfitting. To address this issue, we conducted
a stepwise regression by eliminating non-substantial predictors based on the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC). As a model selection method, BIC has been criticized to
penalize models with large sample sizes too heavily (e.g., James et al. 2013); because of
our small sample, this should not be an issue. Additionally, compared with the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC), BIC tends to be preferable in studies that favor a type 2
over a type 1 error, as AIC tends to favor an overfitted selected model (Kass and
Raftery 1995). In view of our exploratory approach, we therefore chose BIC as our
criterion selection procedure. All predictors shown in Table 2 revealed a substantial
influence except for the linear effect of how many hours students studied, which was
added because it is the lower-order polynomial term of the quadratic predictor of hours

2021 - The advantage of distributed practice in a blended learning setting.pdf,"schedule. Despite the flexibility of distance learning (and the intuitive idea of on-
demand courses), however, the regular scheduling of learning activities appears crucial
to foster academic success in this learning setting. Next to studying regularity, other
behavioral variables emerged as relevant predictors. For example, studying at the
optimal time of the day (congruent with one ’s own chronotype) also had a beneficial
effect on academic success. This finding is interesting and might point out an aspect
that is neglected when assessing behavioral practices that foster learning. It also
highlights the advantage of distance learning, which enables students to avoid the
asynchrony problem with regard to learning times and enables them to learn at the time
of their peak performance (cf. also Horzum et al. 2014). The number of days the
students studied was also chosen by the stepwise regression method and revealed an
inverse relationship with academic success. However, this predictor did not reach
statistical significance ( p = .17) and one should be careful when interpreting this
variable individually as it varies with studying regularity and total hours studied, their
zero-order correlations being r = .33 and r = .75, respectively (see Appendix Fig. 2).
Finally, hours studied had a quadratic impact on academic success (significant by
trend), with students studying for many hours and students studying for a few hours
showing the best performance in the exam. This finding is in line with previous
research (see, e.g., Masui et al. 2014; Plant et al. 2005).
In this study, learners ’ behaviors had a substantial impact on academic success (the
model explains 24% of the variance), whereas learners ’ personalities appeared to play a
smaller role. Indeed, all the personality variables were not selected by our statistical
approach. In the next section, we discuss the reasons that might explain these findings.
The variables that were not selected by the stepwise regression were age, gender,
intelligence, self-esteem, motivation, anxiety, self-control, and the Big Five dimen-
sions. Intelligence has been considered one of the most substantial predictors for
academic success (Giofrè et al. 2017;T i a se ta l . 2015), but several studies have also
found the strength of the relationship between intelligence and academic success to
vary among grade levels, with higher education showing the smallest relationship
between the two constructs; the argument is that at each educational level, the worst
students drop out, thus restricting the variance of the IQ distribution that results in
lower correlations (Jensen 1998). Indeed, the IQ distribution of our student sample
shows a mean IQ of 115.69 (see Table 1), one standard deviation above average. We

demand courses), however, the regular scheduling of learning activities appears crucial
to foster academic success in this learning setting. Next to studying regularity, other
behavioral variables emerged as relevant predictors. For example, studying at the
optimal time of the day (congruent with one ’s own chronotype) also had a beneficial
effect on academic success. This finding is interesting and might point out an aspect
that is neglected when assessing behavioral practices that foster learning. It also
highlights the advantage of distance learning, which enables students to avoid the
asynchrony problem with regard to learning times and enables them to learn at the time
of their peak performance. The number of days the
students studied was also chosen by the stepwise regression method and revealed an
inverse relationship with academic success. However, this predictor did not reach
statistical significance and one should be careful when interpreting this
variable individually as it varies with studying regularity and total hours studied, their
zero-order correlations being r = .33 and r = .75, respectively (see Appendix Fig. 2).
Finally, hours studied had a quadratic impact on academic success (significant by
trend), with students studying for many hours and students studying for a few hours
showing the best performance in the exam. This finding is in line with previous
research.
In this study, learners ’ behaviors had a substantial impact on academic success (the
model explains 24% of the variance), whereas learners ’ personalities appeared to play a
smaller role. Indeed, all the personality variables were not selected by our statistical
approach. In the next section, we discuss the reasons that might explain these findings.
The variables that were not selected by the stepwise regression were age, gender,
intelligence, self-esteem, motivation, anxiety, self-control, and the Big Five dimen-
sions. Intelligence has been considered one of the most substantial predictors for
academic success, but several studies have also
found the strength of the relationship between intelligence and academic success to
vary among grade levels, with higher education showing the smallest relationship
between the two constructs; the argument is that at each educational level, the worst
students drop out, thus restricting the variance of the IQ distribution that results in
lower correlations. Indeed, the IQ distribution of our student sample
shows a mean IQ of 115.69 (see Table 1), one standard deviation above average. We"
2021 - The advantage of distributed practice in a blended learning setting.pdf,"therefore suggest that IQ did not predict academic success in our sample, as it did not
contain enough students with a below-average IQ, meaning that most of the students
met and exceeded IQ requirements for the course to an extent that IQ would no longer
predict academic success. Although there is some evidence showing the positive impact
of self-esteem on academic success (Giofrè et al. 2017), a meta-analysis only found a
small overall effect ( r = .08) of positive self-beliefs on academic success (Valentine
et al. 2004). It is important to mention that we did not assess academic self-esteem but
general self-esteem. The authors report inconsistent findings when considering different
dimensions of self-esteem (see, e.g., Pullmann and Allik 2008). Previous research also
found an impact of motivation (Busato et al. 2000; Komarraju et al. 2009) and anxiety

control (Tangney et al. 2004; Zhu et al. 2016) and conscientiousness (Busato et al.
2000; Chamorro-Premuzic and Furnham 2003;G i o f r èe ta l .2017; Kappe and van der
Flier 2012; Noftle and Robins 2007; Poropat 2009). Our methodological and statistical
approach can explain these inconsistent findings. As motivation was assessed weekly,
the students might not have answered the motivational questions diligently; indeed,
motivation showed a negative correlation with how many exercises the students
completed in our dataset ( r = −.20; see Appendix Fig. 2). Motivation was also
negatively correlated with conscientiousness ( r = −.27; see Appendix Fig. 2), possibly
reflecting an acquiescence bias in demotivated students. Openness, agreeableness,
neuroticism, and extraversion were not selected by the stepwise regression either. This
finding is consistent with a meta-analysis that analyzed over 250 correlation coeffi-
cients and did not find any impact of these four personality dimensions on the academic
success (i.e., grades) of students in German universities (Trapmann et al. 2007),
perhaps ultimately reflecting an unbiased teaching style because, for example, more
extraverted students did not show any advantage. Trapmann et al. ( 2007)f o u n da
positive impact of conscientiousness on academic success, whereas in our study,
conscientiousness was not selected. Surprisingly, self-control was not selected either,
whereas previous research has pointed out self-control as one of the most important
self-regulatory strategies necessary to succeed in higher education, in general
(Puzziferro 2008), and in distance learning, in particular (Radovan 2011; Zhu et al.
2016). Overall, the results are encouraging, as they highlight that study strategy might
be more important than personality variables, such as intelligence.
Finally, learners ’ personality variables were related to behavioral variables (see
Appendix Fig. 2), thus suggesting that these variables might very well play an indirect
role in academic success. Generally, we want to draw attention here to the fact that
variables must be interpreted in relation to the other variables selected in the model.
One of the strengths of this study is its extensive inquiry into the personality and
behavioral variables of students; while there is comprehensive literature on various

here that we do not suggest personality variables to be uninfluential on academic
success; rather, we propose that in a blended distance learning setting in higher
education, behavioral variables, such as using effective learning strategies, may out-
weigh the impact of personality on academic success.
Some limitations of the study should be considered when interpreting the

includes other aspects, such as attainment of learning outcomes (Chamorro-
Premuzic and Furnham 2003), career success (York et al. 2015), or satisfaction
(Lo 2010;Y o r ke ta l . 2015). Future research would benefit from integrating these

factors such as selection bias. Indeed, 24.75% of the students de-registered from

7 Conclusion
Since the beginning of the digital era, the use of online learning tools and digital
approaches has increased remarkably, an effect which has recently been amplified by
the current COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 situation, new ap-
proaches of online learning are emerging and future interest in the topic is striking. To
optimize learning efficiency and minimize teaching bias, however, it is paramount to
investigate variables predicting academic success in such settings. Various previous
studies showed personality traits, cognitive abilities as well as learning behavior to be
crucial determinants for academic success in face to face on-campus settings. Given the
high levels of autonomy and flexibility in a blended learning setting, learners ’ behav-
iors could prove especially crucial for academic success. The present study sought to
identify the most essential predictors for academic success in a blended learning setting
taking both learners ’ personalities and behaviors into account. In summary, this work
provides an important initial contribution by showing the predicting variables of
academic success in a blended learning setting. Behavioral variables seem to be the
essential contributors to academic success in a model that also considers personality
and intelligence. Foremost, distributed practice at the optimal time of the day seems to
be the key to academic success. This is very much in line with the notion that distance
learning is a successful approach to reduce the asynchrony problem. We hope that this
study will inspire further research to better understand the predicting variables of
academic success in the digital era we are living in.
