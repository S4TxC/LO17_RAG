performance of the students. Few are given below:- 
 
 Student abilities and their personal characteristics 
 Faculties abilities and their personal characteristics 
 Level of interaction between students and faculties

Learners, Learning processes and Learning situations are three focal areas of education. The academic class 
is generally not homogeneous but heterogeneous. [12] There are Fast, Average and Slow Learners in the class. 
Students p ass through various stages of physical development such as infancy, childhood and adolescence. 
These development stages have their own characteristics. If the prospective teacher knows these characteristics, 
then he/she can utilize the students in impartin g instruction and molding their behaviors according to the 
specified goal of education.  
The learning ability is not the same in all.  As learning depends on one’s level of intelligence, interest and 
motivation, significantly the rate of learning differs from one to one. One may be fast learner and other takes 
more time to learn the same thing. The Rate of learning can be measured by the following formula: 
Rate of learning =  
Amount of learning proficiency achieved
Time taken to achieve the amount of learning                                                                             (1)

Other than personal characteristics, many factor such as previous academic backgrou nd, study habits, family 
background, self motivation, etc., affect the students’ academic performance. Identifying the high potential 
factors can help the teachers and parents to make the students to increase their academic performance [1]. It can 
also create awareness to students about their responsibilities to achieve the higher studies and importance about 
education [13].

an on -line discussion forum. With the proper format data, classification and classification via clustering 
techniques are applied and compared. Finally, the obtained classification models are described and compared to 
clustering models and additional mining association rules for each other. 
Anne-Sophie, Hoffait, Michael Schyns [10] used data mining methods to present a new means of identifying 
freshmen’s profiles likely to face major difficulties to complete their first academic year. Their study also 
designed algorithm to increase the accuracy of the prediction. 
Ashwin Satya N arayana, Marinsz Nuckowski [11] used multiple classifiers (Decision Trees - J48, Naï ve 
Bayes and Random Forest) to improve the quality of student s’ data by eliminating noisy instances and hence 
improving predictive accuracy. Also their paper identified asso ciation rules that influence students’ outcome 
using a combination of rule based techniques (Apriori, Filtered Associator and Terius). 
Pandey and Taruna [17] proposed the integrated multiple classifiers for the predictions of students’ academic 
performance. A product of probability combining rule is employed to integrate the multiple classifiers that 
consists of three complementary algorithms, namely D ecision Tree, K -Nearest Neighbo r, and Aggregating 
One-Dependence Estimators (AODE). Their method has been a pplied and compared on three student 
performance datasets using t-test. Also this method is compared with KSTAR, OneR, ZeroR, Naive Bayes, and 
NB tree classifiers as well as with the individual classifiers. 
R. Asif, A. Merceron and M. K. Pathan [19] used D ata Mining Techniques to explore the possibility of 
students’ performance prediction based on their academic data at an early stage of their degree program. In 
their study, two datasets were fed to the MLP network and other mining techniques such as Decision Tree, Rule 
Induction, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Naive Bayes. From this work, t he result shows Naive Bayes performed 
best than other techniques. It also stated that students’ degree performance prediction is possible without any 
socio-economic or demograph ic feature but with just their academic data (Pre -university marks and marks 
obtained in year 1 and year 2). 
Abimbola R. Iyanda, Olufemi D. Ninan, Anuoluwapo O. Ajayi and Ogochukwu G. Anyabolu [18] compared 
two neural network models (Multilayer Perceptron and Generalized Regression Neural Network) with a view to 
identifying the best model for predicting students’ academic performance based on single performance factor.  
In this study, only the academic factor (students’ results) was considered as the single  performance factor. The 
result obtained in this study shows that Generalized Regression Neural Network had a better accuracy although 
Multilayer Perceptron had prediction accuracy of 75%.

6. Feature Selection 
Feature selection is the process of selecting a particular feature from a massive collection of features. It plays 
an important role in machine learning and data mining. The features that contribute high for predicting variable 
or output can be selected automatically through feature selection methods. Feature selection is also termed as 
variable selection or attributes selection or variable subset selection [20]. 
Traditional feature selection process consists of four basic steps namely, subset generation, subset evaluation, 
stopping criterion and validation. Subset  generation is a search process that produces candidate feature subsets 
for evaluation based on certain search strategy. Each candidate feature subset is evaluated and compared with 
previous best one based on certain evaluation. If the new subset turns to be better, it replaces the best one and 
this process is repeated until a given stopping condition is satisfied [21].  
Feature selection is important because it reduces the dimensionality of f eature space, removes redundant or  
irrelevant, or noisy data to i ncrease the prediction accuracy. Filter, Wrapper and Embedded are three methods 
of feature selection algorithms. Speeding up a data mining algorithm, improving the data quality, improving the 
performance of data mining and increasing the clarity of the min ing results are the significance of feature 
selection methods. The key benefits of feature selections are [2, 3, 6]:- 
 
 Reduce Overfitting 
 Improves Accuracy 
 Reduce Training Time 
 
7. Ensemble Method 
Ensemble methods are used to create stronger (i.e., more accurate) classification tree models and this can be 
done by combining weak classification tree models to create stronger versions.  Ensemble method is a learning 
method that combines multiple models into one  and it performs better than the standard methods . Ensembles 
are useful with all modeling algorithms. Ensemble Data Mining Methods is also termed as Committee Methods 
or Model Combiners [4].  An ensemble classifier detects noisy instances by constructing set of classifiers [11]. 
It increases the accuracy and reduces the variability of classification. Generally, ensemble methods improve the 
generalization performance of a set of classifiers in a domain.  
The benefits of using an ensemble classification models are [14]: 
 
a) the ensemble classifier is likely to have a lower error rate 
b) the variance  of the ensemble classifier will be lower than had we used certain unstable classification 
models, such as decision tress and neural networks, that have high variability

 BAGGing, or Bootstrap AGGregating . Building multiple models from different subsamples of the 
training dataset and uses each of them to generate a classifier for inclusion in the ensemble. 
 Boosting. Building multiple models each of which learns to fix the prediction errors of a prior model in 
the chain. The term boosting refers to a family of algorithms that are able to convert weak learners to 
strong learners [22]. 
 Voting. Building multiple models and simple statistics are used to combine predictions. 
 
The methods for constructing ensembles are 
 
 By manipulating the training set

8.  Extra Tree Classifier 
Extra-Tree method stands for extremely randomized trees. Extra Tree is a form of Bagging where Random 
trees are constructed from subsamples of the training dataset. Through ExtraTree  Classifier, extra tree model is 
constructed [5]. Instead of computing the locally optimal feature or split combination based on information 
gain or the Gini impur ity, for each feature under consideration, a random value is selected for the split. This 
value is selected from the feature's empirical range . Features that produce large values are ranked as more 
important than featu res which produce small values [23]. In our work, a mong forty five attributes, the high 
potential factors are identified and listed in the Table 2.
