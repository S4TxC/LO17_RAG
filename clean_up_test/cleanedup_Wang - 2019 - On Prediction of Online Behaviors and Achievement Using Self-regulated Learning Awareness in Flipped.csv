Abstract—The present research aims to explore the 
relationships between self-regulated learning (SRL) awareness, 
online behaviors and achievement by investigating whether 
SRL awareness measured at the beginning of the semester can 
predict online learning behaviors and achievement in the 
flipped classroom model. Psychometric data about SRL 
awareness and log data were collected and analyzed using 
multiple linear regression. Motivated Strategies for Learning 
Questionnaire (MSLQ) and a Moodle platform were used as 
data collection tools. Five flipped courses with a total of 93 
undergraduates of a university in Taiwan were included in the 
present study. The results indicated that 1) task value, intrinsic 
motivation, control of learning beliefs and metacognition 
predict achievement, 2) SRL awareness predicts online 
behaviors to a limited extent, 3) combination of SRL awareness 
and online behaviors predicts achievement better than either 
one of the single-domain models. Theoretical contributions and 
implications for education and practice, and future research of 
the present study are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The flipped classroom model has attracted much research 
attention in recent years because of its potential for helping 
learners reach high levels of learning goals [1], [2]. The 
flipped classroom model is an approach to blended learning 
comprising an in-class face- to-face environment and an 
online learning environment supporting both in-class and 
out-of-class learning activities. In general, the flipped 
classroom model creates a learning environment requiring 
learners to exert their self-regulation skills to attain learning 
goals. 
Numerous studies have examined the effectiveness of the 
flipped classroom approach compared to traditional 
lecture-based instructions, however, the results are 
inconsistent [3], [4]. One reason for these inconsistent 
findings may be that different characteristics of learners were 
not addressed [5]. Therefore, the present study is aimed to 
explore the relationships between self-regulated learning 
(SRL) awareness, online behaviors and achievement by 
investigating whether self-regulated learning awareness 
measured at the beginning of the semester can predict online

II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. Flipped Classroom 
The flipped classroom model allows learners to control 
and participate in their learning processes autonomously 
through self-regulated learning [7]. Moreover, individual 
learners should be prepared for classroom learning activities 
before class. Since learners face pre-class activities alone, 
they need to develop self-regulating skills to regulate their 
motivation to complete pre-class activities [8], [9].  
Flipped classrooms supported by a digital LMS platform 
create a learning environment that facilitates self-regulated 
learning [10], [11]. In particular, behavioral engagement in a 
flipped classroom could be enhanced if the learning 
environment encourages learners to develop skills to regulate 
by themselves and pursue self-formed goals [11], [12].   
B. Self-regulated Learning 
Self-regulated learning is defined as a learning process in 
which a learner systematically directs his thoughts, feelings, 
and behaviors towards his own objectives [13]. According to 
the self-regulating model proposed by Schraw, Crippen, and 
Hartley [14], the self-regulated learning process consists of 
three components: cognition, metacognition and motivation. 
The motivation component consists of self-efficacy and 
epistemological beliefs that affect the use and development of 
cognitive and metacognitive strategies in the SRL process. 
Cognition includes learning skills, such as cognitive 
strategies, problem-solving strategies, and critical thinking 
skills, which enable learners to encode, memorize and recall 
information [15]. The metacognition component includes 
skills that enable learners to understand and monitor 
cognitive processes.

Wang - 2019 - On Prediction of Online Behaviors and Achievement Using Self-regulated Learning Awareness in Flipped.pdf,"Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) [16]. The MSLQ survey 
featured Likert-type questions divided into two sections: 
motivation and learning strategies. The motivational section 
consists of value, expectancy beliefs, and affective 
components. The learning strategy section assesses three 
constructs: cognitive, metacognitive, and resource 
management [17]. The metacognitive construct measures 
learners’ metacognitive self-regulation, whereas the resource 
management construct measures time and study environment, 
effort regulation, peer learning and help seeking.  
SRL awareness has been shown significantly positively 
correlated with academic performance [11], [18]. However, 
most studies were based on cross-sectional data. On the other 
hand, engaging in self-regulatory behavior has been shown 
to be positively related to learning performance [19], [20]. 
However, there are relatively few studies on the effect of 
psychometric SRL awareness on behavioral engagement and 
long-term achievement [21], [22]. 
 
III. METHODS 
A. Study Setting 
The present study used a quantitative research approach 
that focused on levels of SRL awareness, online behavior, 
and achievement of undergraduates in flipped courses. The 
quantitative data includes MSLQ survey data for measuring 
SRL awareness and log data for online behavior. Five courses 
offered by the researcher are the focus of the study. The 
flipped courses were designed based on Merrill’s model [23], 
consisting of activation, demonstration, application and 
integration stages. Before each class began, learners studied 
online material to get ready for classroom problem-solving 
activities, in which learners were grouped to solve problems, 
access and discuss related resources. Learners were asked to 
upload their work to Moodle at the end of the class. After 
class learners can continue to complete unfinished 
assignments within a week or consolidate what they have 
learned by solving other problems or conduct self-assessment 
in Moodle. Finally, to promote learning through reflection, a 
three-minute report per week and a self-reflection of the 
mid-term testing results were conducted through Moodle's 
questionnaire module.  
Each course lasted 18 weeks. The time allotted for one 
class per week was 150 min. MSLQ survey data were 
collected in the fourth week to assess learners’ initial SRL 
awareness. The reason that the survey was conducted in the 
fourth week is to allow learners enough time (at least 3 weeks) 
to adapt to SRL strategies successfully, as suggested by 
Yilmaz and Baydas [7]. A total of 93 valid unduplicated 
responses were used in the survey analysis. All courses were 
conducted by the same instructor in computer classrooms 
facilitated by the Moodle platform, without teaching 
assistants or any e-moderators.  
B. Data Collection and Preparation 
The original MSLQ survey had 81 statements, whereas in 
the current study 53 statements suitable for the research 
purpose were selected. These statements are rated on a 
five-point Likert scale, ranging from “not at all true of me” (1) 
to “very true of me” (5). The reverse questions in the 
questionnaire were also properly handled. The individual 
learner's SRL awareness of a subscale is calculated based on 
the average of his responses to the subscale's questionnaire 
items. The higher the score, the higher the learner’s SRL 
awareness regarding the specific subscale.  
The second method of data collection was log data that 
recorded learners’ online behaviors in Moodle. An activity  
that spanned less than 5 seconds or longer than one hour was 
ignored [24]. The learner’s achievement is his final grade. 
According to the four-component model proposed by Wang 
[25], the behavioral constructs derived from LMS data 
include online study, social interaction, problem solving and 
self-reflection and self-assessment. To measure online 
behavioral engagement, the present study adopts the 
frequency-based and durati on-based approaches [25]. 
Moreover, the behavioral constructs, except for the 
Self-reflection and Self-assessment, were divided into 
in-class behavioral constructs and out-of-class behavioral 
constructs according to the time when the activities occurred. 
All behavioral measurements, and the final grade for each 
course are converted to z-scores before being merged into the 
data set. 
C. Procedure 
First, the reliability of MSLQ subscales and online 
behavioral constructs is validated with Cronbach’s alpha 
(values above .7 indicate good reliability). Thereafter, we 
analyzed: correlations between the MSLQ subscales and 
online behavior; correlations between the MSLQ subscales 
and achievement; and correlations between online behavior 
and achievement. Second, we conducted multiple linear 
regression to assess: the ability of the MSLQ subscales to 
predict online behavior, the ability of the MSLQ subscales to 
predict achievement, the ability of online behavior to predict 
achievement, and the ability of combining MSLQ subscales 
and online behavior to predict achievement. 
 
IV. RESULTS 
A. Correlation Analysis 
Since the data does not conform to the normal distribution, 
Spearman’s correlation analysis was first conducted to 
analyze the zero-order correlation between MSLQ subscales. 
The results show that all Cronbach’s alpha values are above 
0.7, except for the Persistency subscale which is 0.59. Table I 
shows the correlation between the MSLQ subscales and 
achievement. Correlation coefficients above 0.6 indicate a 
strong relationship, moderate if between 0.4 and 0.6, weak if 
between 0.2 and 0.4, otherwise, it is none or very weak. The 
correlations of Intrinsic Motivation, Task Value, Time 
Management and Metacognition with achievement were 
significant but weak, whereas the rest of the MSLQ subscales 
were not found significantly related to achievement.

B. Multiple Linear Regression Analysis 
First, multicollinearity among the MSLQ subscales was 
measured by variance inflation factors (VIF). If the VIF value 
exceeds 10.0, there is a serious problem with 
multicollinearity [26]. Table IV shows the VIF values for 
each MSLQ subscale, and no serious multicollinearity is 
detected.

Multiple linear regressions were carried out to investigate 
whether the SRL-awareness factors could predict online 
behavior and achievement. First, a significant regression 
equation using SRL-awareness factors to predict 
achievement was found (F(9, 83)=3.296, p
<.01), explaining 
26.3% of the variance in achievement. Four S RL-awareness 
factors were found significant, including Intrinsic 
Motivation (β = .361, p
<.05), Task Value (β = .428, p<.05), 
Control of Learning Beliefs ( β = -.562, p<.01), and 
Metacognition (β = .410, p<.05). 
To investigate the relationships between SRL awareness 
and online behavior, multiple regressions were applied 
separately for each type of behavioral engagement using 
SRL-awareness factors as predictors. As shown in Table V, a 
significant regression equation using SRL-awareness factors 
to predict out-of-class online study was found ( F(9, 
83)=2.303, p
<.05, R2=0.200), and Intrinsic Motivation ( β 
= .637, p<.05) positively predicts out-of-class online study. 
Moreover, a significant regression equation using 
SRL-awareness factors to predict out-of-class social 
interaction was found ( F(9, 83)=3.431, p
<.01, R2=0.271), 
and Time Management (β = .786, p<.05) positively predicts 
out-of-class social interaction, whereas Peer Learning ( β = 
-.525, p<.05) negatively predicts out-of-class social 
interaction. It seems Peer Learning was a suppressor variable 
in the behavior prediction model, as its zero-order 
correlations with online behaviors were weak (see Table II).  
No significant SRL-awareness predictors were found for the 
rest of online behaviors.  
Next, multiple linear regressions were carried out to 
investigate whether online behaviors predict achievement . 
Table VI shows that no serious multicollinearity was detected 
for the behavioral constructs. A significant regression 
equation for achievement prediction using online behaviors 
was found (F(7. 85)=7.824, p
<.000), explaining 39.2% of the 
variance. In-class Social Interaction ( β = .248, p<.05) and 
Out-of-class Online Study ( β = .591, p<.01) significantly 
contributed to the model.

<.05), Task Value (β = .428, p<.05), 
Control of Learning Beliefs ( β = -.562, p<.01), and 
Metacognition (β = .410, p<.05). 
To investigate the relationships between SRL awareness 
and online behavior, multiple regressions were applied 
separately for each type of behavioral engagement using 
SRL-awareness factors as predictors. As shown in Table V, a 
significant regression equation using SRL-awareness factors 
to predict out-of-class online study was found ( F(9, 
83)=2.303, p
<.05, R2=0.200), and Intrinsic Motivation ( β 
= .637, p<.05) positively predicts out-of-class online study. 
Moreover, a significant regression equation using 
SRL-awareness factors to predict out-of-class social 
interaction was found ( F(9, 83)=3.431, p
<.01, R2=0.271), 
and Time Management (β = .786, p<.05) positively predicts 
out-of-class social interaction, whereas Peer Learning ( β = 
-.525, p<.05) negatively predicts out-of-class social 
interaction. It seems Peer Learning was a suppressor variable 
in the behavior prediction model, as its zero-order 
correlations with online behaviors were weak (see Table II).  
No significant SRL-awareness predictors were found for the 
rest of online behaviors.  
Next, multiple linear regressions were carried out to 
investigate whether online behaviors predict achievement . 
Table VI shows that no serious multicollinearity was detected 
for the behavioral constructs. A significant regression 
equation for achievement prediction using online behaviors 
was found (F(7. 85)=7.824, p
<.000), explaining 39.2% of the 
variance. In-class Social Interaction ( β = .248, p<.05) and 
Out-of-class Online Study ( β = .591, p<.01) significantly 
contributed to the model. 

Finally, multiple linear regression analysis was used to 
measure the ability of using SRL awareness factors and"
Wang - 2019 - On Prediction of Online Behaviors and Achievement Using Self-regulated Learning Awareness in Flipped.pdf,"online behaviors together to predict achievement. Again, no 
serious multicollinearity was detected for the predictors. A 
significant regression equation was found for the 
achievement prediction model ( F(16, 76)=4.958, p
<.000), 
with an R2 of .511. The predictive power of the models is 
stronger than their counterparts with either SRL awareness 
or behavioral predictors alone. Three SRL awareness 
predictors, Task Value ( β = .359, p<.05), Control of 
Learning Beliefs ( β = -.344, p
<.05), and Metacognition ( β 
= .336, p<.05), and one behavioral predictor, Out-of-class 
Online Study (β = .464, p<.05), were found to be significant. 
Note that the estimated coefficients of Control of Learning 
Beliefs were negative. 
 
V. DISCUSSION 
The relationship between SRL awareness and achievement 
and between SRL awareness and online behavior were weak. 
This is in line with Vogt’s argument that research based on 
the self-report method on the connect ion between learners’ 
genuine learning behavior and learners’ perceptual 
engagement was found either minimal or non-significant 
[27]. On the other hand, the relationship between online 
behavior and achievement was stronger. Previous studies 
have found a correlation between online learning behavior 
and achievement [28], [29]. It reveals that LMS data could 
itself serve as a source of a seamless, real-time and 
non-invasive measure of behavioral engagement in the 
flipped classroom model supported with an online 
component [25], [30]  
Re
garding the regression models, the R-squares of the 
single-domain models with SRL awareness predictors and 
behavioral predictors were respectively 0.263 and 0.392. 
These models were satisfactory regarding the use of 
single-domain predictors to predict long-term learning 
performance. In contrast, the R-square of the regression 
model using both SRL awareness and behavioral predictors 
was 0.511, resulting in a better model that accounted for 
more variance than either one of the single-domain models. 
Moreover, only out-of-class online study and out-of-class 
social interaction were found significantly predictable by 
SRL-awareness factors. The results reveal that the SRL 
awareness measured at the beginning of the semester may not 
explain the long-term online behaviors and achievement 
appropriately because learners’ motivation states may 
change dynamically as the learning context changes during 
the semester. This finding is consistent with the study [31], 
which suggested that the observable indicators can better 
explain learning performance than preliminary subjective 
assessments. Moreover, the present study suggests that using 
both the psychometric SRL awareness factors and the 
genuine online behavioral factors could help establish a 
better prediction model of achievement. 
In addition, the present study shows that task value, 
control of learning beliefs, metacognition and out-of-class 
online study predict achievement significantly. Moreover, 
the results suggest that task value be the strongest 
psychometric predictor of achievement, whereas engagement 
in out- of-class online study be the strongest behavioral 
predictor of achievement in the flipped classrooms. The 
research results are in line with previous ones which show 
that task value has an important effect on student learning 
outcomes [15], [32][31]-[34]. Moreover, several researches 
showed that metacognitive strategies are more closely related 
to achievement [35]-[38]. 
Note that awareness of control of learning beliefs had large 
negative coefficients in all the regression models, indicating 
that it may be a suppressor variable, since the zero-ordered 
correlations of control of learning beliefs with achievement 
was small (see Table I). Therefore, it suggests that there be 
negative interactions between the control of learning beliefs 
and other factors in the models, explanations of which are yet 
to be explored. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
The present study demonstrates that LMS data can be used 
as a source of behavioral engagement metrics, 
supplementing student self-reported motivational data to 
predict achievement [27], [28]. Moreover, the present study 
shows that a mixed method that combines self-reported data 
and online behavioral engagement can provide a superior 
method than either one, which could have the potential to 
offer insights about the dynamics of motivation and 
behavioral engagement in flipped classrooms that, heretofore, 
have yet to be fully explored. 
A. Implications for Education and Practice 
First, the SRL-awareness factors, task value and 
metacognition, were significant positive predictors of 
achievement, implying that active problem-solving activities 
may attract learners with higher sense of task value and 
metacognition in the flipped classrooms. Therefore, teachers 
need to pay attention to the value that learners attach to their 
courses, for example, by designing authentic 
problem-solving activities that meet learners’ task value and 
raise learners’ me tacognitive awareness by helping them 
better manage their cognitive learning during the 
problem-solving process. Moreover, teachers need to help 
learners develop metacognitive skills, for example, by 
presenting information in a way that exerts higher order 
thinking. Second, engagement in out-of-class online study 
significantly predicts achievement. Moreover, raising 
awareness of intrinsic motivation could help learners engage 
in out-of-class online study. Therefore, teachers should raise 
learners’ intrinsic  motivation, for example, by providing 
instructive feedback, encouraging collaboration and helping 
learners setting up greater goals. Teachers should also 
provide active-problem solving activities that could help 
engage learners in out-of-class online study to achieve high 
levels of achievement. 
B. Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research 
First, the data size is small ( n
=93), which may limit the 
generality of the findings. Second, the average of the 
learners’ SRL awareness scores was used in the regress ion

Third, the present study focused only on courses conducted 
by the same instructor. Therefore, more extensive evaluation 
is needed to see the replicability of the findings in courses 
conducted by different instructors. Fourth, because only a 
special student population in the computer discipline was 
involved in the present study, discretion must be exerted to 
apply the results to other populations and disciplines. Finally, 
the present study was an exploratory study, and further 
controlled experiments on the causality that may be implied 
by the relationships are encouraged.  
The present study raises several questions for research. 
First, it is necessary to study why the awareness of control of 
learning beliefs negatively predicts achievement. Second, 
although the present study identifies several important 
SRL-awareness and behavioral factors related to 
achievement, a further analysis of the inter-relationships 
between the SRL-awareness and behavioral factors may 
provide deeper insights that can better explain how these 
factors affect learners’ achievement. Third, controlled 
experiments are needed to confirm the influence of these 
psychometric and behavioral factors on achievement.
