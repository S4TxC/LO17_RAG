ABSTRACT
In this article, we study a set of factors underlying student success in
a bottleneck business course using statistical and data mining tech-
niques. Factors included learning styles, motivational and other cog-
nitive factors, personality traits, learning analytics, along with
background demographic and academic ones. Our analysis yielded
interesting insights that show some of these factors play significant
roles in predicting both student performance and their propensity to
utilize resources that help improve their performance, such as add-
itional support services. The predictive accuracy of both of our mod-
els were over 95% (error rate <5%). Moreover, quantile regression
models were used to determine factors that specifically affect the
performance of low-performing students so that targeted interven-
tion and support services can be developed specifically for them. In
conclusion, deeper analytics via statistical models are crucial for
forming an in-depth understanding of how to improve student per-
formance in a bottleneck course and this has far-reaching implica-
tions for both educators and administrators in higher education.

1. Introduction
Studies of student success in higher education are widely available today as educational
institutions strive to reduce the time it takes students to complete their degrees (Crisp,
Doran, and Reyes 2018). One of the primary factors that contribute to longer gradu-
ation times are“bottleneck” courses, which refer to those courses that have a high level
of difficulty and hence historically high failure rates. To mitigate this, colleges and uni-
versities have conducted research to identify which factors affect performance in such
courses, the knowledge of which can empower them to introduce appropriate help and
support programs to enhance academic success in those. These factors range from
demographic factors (such as, gender, ethnicity) to academic factors (like prior academic
history, grade point average or GPA), although there are several cognitive (like learning
styles, motivational factors) and behavioral (like personality) factors that play a role in
determining student success but are often overlooked (Glesne 1998). More recently,

1. Introduction
Studies of student success in higher education are widely available today as educational
institutions strive to reduce the time it takes students to complete their degrees. One of the primary factors that contribute to longer gradu-
ation times are“bottleneck” courses, which refer to those courses that have a high level
of difficulty and hence historically high failure rates. To mitigate this, colleges and uni-
versities have conducted research to identify which factors affect performance in such
courses, the knowledge of which can empower them to introduce appropriate help and
support programs to enhance academic success in those. These factors range from
demographic factors (such as, gender, ethnicity) to academic factors (like prior academic
history, grade point average or GPA), although there are several cognitive (like learning
styles, motivational factors) and behavioral (like personality) factors that play a role in
determining student success but are often overlooked. More recently,"
Mitra and Le - 2022 - The effect of cognitive and behavioral factors on student success in a bottleneck business statistic.pdf,"institutions of higher education are increasingly collecting data on student learning
behavior to improve educational practices via data-driven decision-making (Elias2011).
Commonly referred to as “learning analytics”, they use tools to track students’ inter-
action and engagement with their learning management system (or, LMS) yielding data
such as the number of times a student accesses the course website, how long they spend
on it, how they navigate through different course activities like lecture slides, assign-
ments, projects, etc. Thus, studying such factors in conjunction with other background
factors has the potential to offer useful insights into academic performance that can be
used not only to devise intervention techniques but also to inform instructors about
how to prepare course materials, design class delivery methods, choose educational tech-
nologies, and develop sensitivity to differing student learning preferences in ways to
enhance student success in bottleneck courses, thereby reducing the time to graduation.
An important set of resources that play a critical role in student success efforts are
academic support services and intervention programs that are particularly designed to
help students who have difficulty in certain courses. Some such programs are remedial
courses, tutoring services, and Supplemental Instruction (SI). Although available for
free, one concern is that a majority of students who need to use them do not do so.
The success of one program, SI, is well-known in terms of improving student perform-
ance and increasing passing rates in several disciplines such as STEM (science, technol-
ogy, engineering and mathematics) fields, humanities and business (Martin and
Arendale 1992; Mitra and Goldstein2018). However, attendance at SI sessions is often
low in some fields, of which one is Business. This necessitates that research studies be
undertaken in order to understand factors that drive consistent participation of students
in them. This is the key to increasing participation in such sessions, which in turn can
increase student success rates in difficult bottleneck courses and facilitate on-
time graduation.
In this article we present a comprehensive research study involving a set of diverse
factors to investigate their role in determining student success in a bottleneck Business
course at a large public university in the western United States. This study builds upon
an earlier study (Mitra and Goldstein2015) which discovered certain background aca-
demic and demographic factors that contributed to the risk of failing such a course and
used the insights to design a two-stage intervention method for at-risk students. The
current study considers several additional variables representing different aspects of stu-
dents’ cognitive abilities and behavior as well as learning analytics that were not
included in the prior study. Specifically, we also isolate factors that affect performance
of low-performing students who need the most assistance to succeed and compare with
those for high-performing ones. Further, we explore which subset of factors help predict
a student’s willingness in seeking additional help and support meant to help improve
student performance and success in such a course. The findings from our analyses con-
ducted using advanced statistical and data mining methods will thus significantly con-
tribute toward improving performance and success in this difficult course for a diverse
group of students.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. We start with an overview of existing
literature on factors contributing to student success and participation in academic sup-
port programs like SI, followed by our research goals, data, methods and results. We

2. Background and literature review
The level of success students achieve in their years at college has far-reaching implica-
tions for students’ personal and professional lives, persistence in elected majors, perse-
verance in higher education, and their success in career. However, disaffection with low
performance in introductory college classes is a serious problem at colleges and univer-
sities nationwide (Horn and Premo 1995; Horn, Peter, and Rooney 2002). For more
than two decades, research has shown that student success in STEM disciplines is most
negatively affected by students’ lack of success in gateway courses that develop essential
skills and introduce students to disciplinary studies (Tobias1990; Seymour and Hewitt
1997) but often have high failure rates, thus causing a“bottleneck” in the graduation
timeline. The problem is especially evident in introductory business, mathematics, and
science courses that are often required and are integral components of an undergradu-
ate curriculum. Yet, many students who enroll in these courses achieve moderate or low
levels of success in them, resulting in delayed graduation and attrition of students
(Gainen 1995).
Much research has been conducted on identifying factors that affect student perform-
ance and success in bottleneck courses, from demographic ones such as, gender, ethni-
city (Herndon and Moore2002; Brower and Ketterhagen2004) to academic factors like
GPA, prior academic history and class attendance (Romer 1993; Devadoss and Foltz
1996). Similarly, noncognitive factors or qualitative factors have been used successfully
to predict grades in many courses in several areas of study. One such factor isacademic
self-concept, defined as a person’s general composite view of themselves toward their
own academic skills, knowledge, and capabilities based on past experiences and self-
evaluations (Snow, Corno, and Jackson1996; Byrnes 2003). Although such factors are
often overlooked (Glesne1999), some studies have shown that these variables are more
useful than cognitive variables in predicting academic success of nontraditional students
(e.g., Sedlacek 2004). Meece, Anderman, and Anderman (2006) found a relationship
between student motivation and academic self-concept in introductory Mathematics
courses. Academic self-concept was shown to be a strong predictor of persistence in
undergraduate math programs and in fact, a stronger predictor of final grades for
females than for males (House1995).
Although research on student success has been conducted for a long time, the wide-
spread availability of data that are collected by educational institutions have recently paved
the path for application of more rigorous data mining techniques in order to gather deeper
insights about student performance and success in order to facilitate decision-making by
students, teachers and administrators (Dutt, Ismail, and Herawan2017). This field, com-
monly known as Educational Data Mining (EDM), is growing. Fatima, Fatima, and
Krishna Prasad (2015) conducted a survey of EDM tools to develop models for improving
student experiences. Manjula (2018) implemented k-means clustering algorithm for the pur-
pose of analyzing an educational dataset. Kaur and Bathla (2018) applied Naïve Bayes and
Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict student performance based on data obtained

and applications that have existed over the last 10 years.
2.1. Personality traits
Personality has been defined in several ways but according to the American Psychology
Association (APA), personality refers to individual differences in characteristic patterns of
thinking, feeling, and behaving (American Psychological Association (APA)2018). Various
personality assessment tools have been studied in the literature, but the most important
one is the Big Five Inventory (BFI) model (Goldberg1992; Saucier and Goldberg1996),
which we employ in this study. The Big Five personality dimensions include the following:
/C15 openness: this trait is associated with imagination and curiosity, and makes people
more tolerant, creative, and interested in variety;
/C15 conscientiousness: this trait is associated with efficiency, preparedness, and depend-
ability and makes people work hard, be disciplined, and be achievement-oriented;
/C15 extraversion: this trait is linked with sociability and positive affect, and makes peo-
ple fun-loving, assertive, and optimistic;
/C15 agreeableness: this trait is linked with kindness and sensitivity, and makes people
sympathetic, trusting, supportive, and nurturing, and
/C15 neuroticism (or emotional instability):this trait is associated with the ability to con-
trol one’s emotions and people who are highly neurotic tend to be anxious, tem-
peramental, and prone to emotional distress.
There is evidence from earlier research studies that personality traits can predict aca-
demic achievement (Costa and McCrae 1992). According to O’Connor and Paunonen
(2007), students’ behavioral tendencies are often reflected in their personality traits that
can in turn influence certain behaviors related to academic performance such as persever-
ance and conscientiousness. A number of works has shown that conscientiousness affects
academic motivation and success (Wagerman and Funder2007; Clark and Schroth2010).
Often academic motivation is seen to mediate the relationship between personality traits
and academic achievement (Hazrati-Viari, Rad, and Torabi2012). Payne, Youngcourt,
and Beaubien (2007) found that students who have high levels of conscientiousness, extra-
version and openness have greater motivation to learn and hence perform well whereas
Komarraju, Karau, and Schmeck (2009) observed that students with low levels of extra-
version and high levels of neuroticism have low motivation in studies and do not perform
well. In fact, many education researchers believe that neuroticism has a negative relation-
ship with academic motivation and performance and the other three traits have a positive
relationship with these factors (Komarraju and Karau2005).
2.2. Learning styles
The idea that students have different learning styles and preferences is now widely
accepted (Wratcher et al.1997). It is important that educators today are aware of these
diverse learning styles in the student population which have a direct impact on their

Mitra and Le - 2022 - The effect of cognitive and behavioral factors on student success in a bottleneck business statistic.pdf,"performance in college. Yet not all faculty take these into account while teaching.
Hence, teaching methods adopted by instructors are not always effective, particularly
across different class formats like face-to-face and online. For instance, research sug-
gests that online classes are best suited for students who are self-motivated, self-disci-
plined and have effective time management skills (McEwan 2001; Huber and Lowry
2003). This suggests that students who lack these characteristics yet enroll in online
courses, may struggle and subsequently drop these courses, delaying their degree com-
pletion and graduation. It is thus essential that instructors have knowledge of students’
learning styles and other cognitive factors and their impact on performance in order
to design and deliver effective instruction for a diverse group of students (Lo and
Shu 2005).
Individuals learn in different ways, like watching, listening, questioning, doing, and
helping others to learn (Rogers and Freiberg1994). Different learners process informa-
tion differently because of different cognitive and learning styles, and exposure to differ-
ent learning environments and experiences (Scarr1992; Cassidy 2004). An individual’s
learning style will affect how information is processed during learning and thinking,
thereby impacting learning effectiveness and efficiency (Bencheva 2010). One of the
most broadly known learning style inventories used in education research today is
Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory(LSI) (Kolb 1981; 1986), which we focus on in our study.
The LSI posits learning is a four-stage circular process, and classifies learners as con-
vergers, divergers, assimilators and accommodators. Each of the four stages correspond
to four broad types of learning styles: (1) Concrete experience – CE (feeling), (2)
Abstract conceptualization – AC (thinking), (3) Active experimentation – AE (doing),
and (4) Reflective observation– RO (watching). CE and RO constitute the“diverging”
style of learning which enables a person to look at things from different perspectives
and learn by watching and viewing concrete situations (rather than doing). People with
this style typically have broad interests and like to gather information. The
“assimilating” learning style is comprised of AC and RO, which utilizes a concise and
logical approach via clear explanations to understand ideas and concepts rather than
practical experiences. AC and AE characterize people with a“converging” learning style
prefer to solve problems and find practical uses for the concepts and theories learned.
Lastly, the “accommodating” learning style encompasses CE and AE and is hands-on,
relying on intuition rather than logic. People with this style often use other people’s
analysis and adopt a practical and experiential approach.
A substantial literature in business education studies the effect of learning styles on
student performance. Kolb (1981) found that learning styles of over 800 managers and
business graduate students varied with their undergraduate major. Other research found
finance and accounting majors prefer a convergent learning style while marketing and
management students were mostly experience-oriented (accommodators and divergers)
(Bergevin 1993). Students in accounting, finance, marketing, and management informa-
tion systems preferred an assimilator style using the Kolb LSI (Loo2002), while visual
and kinesthetic styles were preferred for introductory accounting students (Shoemaker
and Kelly 2015). On the other hand, a study of over 400 undergraduate students in a
financial management class using Kolb’s LSI found that learning styles did not impact
student performance (Fox and Bartholomae1999).

Mitra and Le - 2022 - The effect of cognitive and behavioral factors on student success in a bottleneck business statistic.pdf,"2.3. Goal orientations, motivational factors, and other cognitive factors
Goal orientations are cognitive frameworks that influence motivation in achievement
settings (Elliot and Dweck1988). Two types of goal orientations have implications for
the tasks students choose, how they approach these tasks, how they react to outcomes,
and ultimately, what they learn: (1) learning (mastery) goals, which focus students ’
attention and effort on developing and improving their competencies, and (2)perform-
ance goals, which focus students’ attention and effort on demonstrating their competen-
cies and outperforming their peers. Learning and performance goal orientations can be
crossed with approach and avoid goals to form the 2 x 2 model of achievement goal
orientations which include: (i) learning approach goals (LGO), (ii) learning avoid goals
(LAGO), (iii) performance approach goals (PGO), and (iv) performance avoid goals
(PAGO) (e.g., Elliot and McGregor2001; Kozlowski and Bell2006). For instance, learn-
ing avoidance goals focus attention and effort on avoiding skill losses. Performance
avoidance goals focus on avoiding the appearance of incompetence or avoiding doing
worse than one’s peers. Research with college students has shown learning approach
goals predicted intrinsic interest, while performance approach goals predicted grades
(Elliot and Church1997; Elliot and McGregor2001).
For students to succeed in a course, motivational factors play a significant role. Self-
determination theory posits motivation can be assessed along an intrinsic-extrinsic con-
tinuum (Deci et al.1991; Ryan and Deci2000). Intrinsically motivated behaviors include
task engagement the individual finds genuinely interesting and inherently satisfying. An
autonomous motivational style toward the intrinsic end of the continuum and is thus
characterized by self-regulated and self-determined motivation. On the other hand, a
controlled style lies toward the extrinsic end of the continuum and is experienced as
motivation driven by external factors rather than inherent interest. In educational set-
tings, students with an autonomous motivational style are more likely to engage in
activities that enhance their learning while individuals with a controlled motivational
style are more inclined to focus their effort and attention on activities that can improve
their grades (Black and Deci2000; Ryan and Deci2000).
Among other meta-cognitive factors that have a potential impact on academic
achievement of students, the most important ones are self-regulated learning such as
intrinsic value (Pintrich and De Groot1990). Self-regulated learning may include stu-
dents’ meta-cognitive strategies for planning, monitoring, and modifying their cognition
(Zimmerman and Pons1988), their management of effort on various tasks and activities
pertaining to the course, and the cognitive processes they use for learning, understand-
ing and mastering course content. Intrinsic value is also an important component of
students’ own choice or interest in becoming cognitively engaged in their academic
work. A study of science learners showed that both self-regulated learning and intrinsic
value were positively related to students ’ engagement and academic performance
(Pintrich and De Groot1990).
Finally, procrastination, defined as a voluntary, irrational delay of behavior, has been
found to impair individual academic and work group performance (Jiao et al. 2011;
Lakshminarayan, Potdar, and Reddy 2012). Groups with the lowest levels of achieve-
ment tended to include students who procrastinated most frequently on administrative
tasks and academic work. Procrastination is widely prevalent among college students
2784 S. MITRA AND K. LE","2.3. Goal orientations, motivational factors, and other cognitive factors
Goal orientations are cognitive frameworks that influence motivation in achievement
settings. Two types of goal orientations have implications for
the tasks students choose, how they approach these tasks, how they react to outcomes,
and ultimately, what they learn: (1) learning (mastery) goals, which focus students ’
attention and effort on developing and improving their competencies, and (2)perform-
ance goals, which focus students’ attention and effort on demonstrating their competen-
cies and outperforming their peers. Learning and performance goal orientations can be
crossed with approach and avoid goals to form the 2 x 2 model of achievement goal
orientations which include: (i) learning approach goals (LGO), (ii) learning avoid goals
(LAGO), (iii) performance approach goals (PGO), and (iv) performance avoid goals
(PAGO). For instance, learn-
ing avoidance goals focus attention and effort on avoiding skill losses. Performance
avoidance goals focus on avoiding the appearance of incompetence or avoiding doing
worse than one’s peers. Research with college students has shown learning approach
goals predicted intrinsic interest, while performance approach goals predicted grades.
For students to succeed in a course, motivational factors play a significant role. Self-
determination theory posits motivation can be assessed along an intrinsic-extrinsic con-
tinuum. Intrinsically motivated behaviors include
task engagement the individual finds genuinely interesting and inherently satisfying. An
autonomous motivational style toward the intrinsic end of the continuum and is thus
characterized by self-regulated and self-determined motivation. On the other hand, a
controlled style lies toward the extrinsic end of the continuum and is experienced as
motivation driven by external factors rather than inherent interest. In educational set-
tings, students with an autonomous motivational style are more likely to engage in
activities that enhance their learning while individuals with a controlled motivational
style are more inclined to focus their effort and attention on activities that can improve
their grades.

achievement of students, the most important ones are self-regulated learning such as

2.4. Learning analytics
With the advance of technology in the last decade, we have the emergence of a field
called learning analytics in which sophisticated analysis are performed to improve learn-
ing and education (Elias2011). Learning analytics is defined by the Society for Learning
Analytics Research (SOLAR) as“the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of
data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing
learning and the environments in which it occurs” (SOLAR website). It uses tools and
methods from business intelligence, web analytics, statistics and data mining to analyze
large repositories of data available at colleges and universities, mostly through integra-
tion with their Learning Management Systems (LMS). Such vast amounts of data on
student behavior may include user visits, attempts on assignments, number of down-
loads, LMS tools accessed, and number of contributions to a discussion forum, that can
provide the instructor with real-time information to improve student engagement
(Educause 2010; Beer, Clark, and Jones 2010). This helps the instructor to track and
determine which students may need help and when so that he or she may reach out to
those students via email as a way of intervention. This also helps the development of
personalized learning environments to refine course offerings for users.
An Educause survey conducted recently also showed that institutions are more com-
monly using learning analytics to monitor and study student progress and success
although there are concerns regarding data quality, difficulties in system integration,
and ethical issues (Arroway et al.2016) while Borden and Coates (2017) discussed how
learning analytics can be used effectively to provide insights into collegiate experience
via the development of a conceptual framework and advancement of institutional sys-
tems. Many studies have also focused on the correlation between students’ LMS usage
and their performance (Filippidi, Tselios, and Komis2010; Jo, Kim, and Yoon2014)a s
well as with their satisfaction with courses offered via LMS (Naveh, Tubin, and Pliskin
2012). Kesahavamurthy and Guruprasad (2014) presented a survey of research con-
ducted on learning analytics along with several applications to predict student perform-
ance and detect at-risk students. According to MacFayden and Dawson ( 2010)
predictive models for monitoring student achievement should be built at the course
level, and they were able to identify struggling students in need to academic support
based on LMS data. Whitmer (2012) observed that learning analytics explained over
four times the variation in final grades compared to traditional student characteristics.
Yu and Jo (2014) predicted students’ learning achievement through analyzing data from
Moodle LMS for 84 students at a university in South Korea. Mwalumbwe and Mtebe
(2017) discovered that time spent in the LMS and number of logins and downloads did
not have any significant impact on students’ learning performance in blended courses,
while discussion posts and peer interaction through the LMS did. West, Searle, and

2.5. Supplemental Instruction (SI) and help-seeking behavior
Research studies have shown that Supplemental Instruction (SI) is effective at improving
academic performance of students who participate (Ogden et al.2003; Malm, Bryngfors,
and Morner 2010; 2011), with the greatest impacts seen on students who are at risk
(Shaya, Petty, and Petty1993) and ethnic minority students (Wilcox and Koehler2007).
Moreover, SI has been found to significantly enhance reasoning and problem-solving
skills (Shaya, Petty, and Petty1993) and increase retention (Lyle and Robinson2003),
GPA (Fayowski and MacMillan 2008), and graduation rates (Congos 2003; Bowles,
McCoy, and Bates2008), specifically in STEM-related fields (Peters et al.2007). In add-
ition, SI provides students the training necessary to learn and assimilate study skills that
they take with them to future semesters (Peters et al.2007; Fayowski and MacMillan
2008). In the context of Business courses, Kenney ( 1989) and Kenney and Kallison
(1994) conducted several studies that demonstrated the effectiveness of SI in first-semester
calculus classes for business and economics majors at a university. Mitra and Goldstein
(2018) recently discovered a positive impact of SI on the performance and success of stu-
dents in Business courses, particularly for at-risk students. In fact, the success of this pro-
gram led the United States Department of Education (USDOE) to designate it as an
“Exemplary Educational Program” in 1981 (Burmeister1996;W i d m a r1994), which resulted
in widespread SI implementation throughout the country. SI is one of the academic success
programs that is expected to benefit students in bottleneck courses, which we study in
this article.
Despite the extensive study of the impact of SI, participation in SI sessions, particu-
larly regarding consistent participation, is understudied in the current literature. Yet,
this is important to understand because an inherent problem for any academic assist-
ance program in colleges (such as tutoring or SI), is that these are voluntary and require
initiative on the part of the students. Hence it is important for academic advisors to
have some insights and understanding of how students seek help voluntarily and also
how intervention impacts the likelihood of participation. This will ensure that students
are utilizing all available resources that will help them achieve academic success.Help-
seeking has been identified as one of the processes of self-regulated learning
(Zimmerman 1998; Newman 2002) and is typically exhibited by students with high
levels of self-efficacy and social skills. Schunk and Ertmer (2000) pointed out that help-
seeking is a complex process that involves several dimensions – cognitive and motiv-
ational. Karabenick and Knapp ( 1991) looked at help-seeking in higher education
settings and found that help-seeking could be properly viewed as an achievement-
related learning strategy rather than as a manifestation of dependency. Magnusson and
Perry (1992) found that help-seeking in college students was influenced by both class-
room factors and teacher characteristics. Ryan, Gheen, and Midgley (1998) mentioned
that help-seeking behavior was positively correlated with high self-efficacy. Often stu-
dents who are at risk of failing are unable to seek proper help; according to Hodges
and White (2001), such students may not be as capable of understanding the need to

erature also contains evidence that sometimes interventions can be effective at improv-
ing help-seeking behavior in such students (Dweck1986). This is particularly pertinent
and important for at-risk students and has not been studied comprehensively for aca-
demic support programs like SI.
3. Research goals and methods
The goal of this article is to form a deep understanding of which factors affect the per-
formance of students in a bottleneck Business course via statistical models that are able
to provide very useful insights which can in turn be used to improve performance for
students to a considerable extent. In particular, we consider a diverse set of factors,
from students’ background demographic and academic factors to cognitive factors like
learning and motivational styles, help-seeking behavior to personality traits and learning
analytics. Such a comprehensive and rigorous study, to the best of our knowledge, has
not been undertaken before for such a course. Our specific study objectives as follows:
1. identify which of these cognitive, behavioral, and engagement factors affect student
performance;
2. identify which of the above-mentioned factors particularly have an influence on the
performance and success of low-performing students, and how this differs from fac-
tors affecting the performance of high-performing students;
3. identify which of these factors are associated with students ’ propensity to utilize
extra resources available to aid at-risk students (such as, Supplemental Instruction
or SI);
4. use the above outcomes to build statistical predictive models for student success
and participation in support programs.
The results from the above analyses will thus provide the huge benefit of informing
instructors and advisors in the university beforehand which subgroups of students are
likely to succeed in this difficult course and which subgroups are likely to regularly take
advantage of additional resources (like SI) to get help during the course, so that suitable
steps may be taken to address them. Such outcomes will go a long way in diminishing
the bottleneck in such courses and leading to shorter overall graduation time for stu-
dents enrolled in a degree program.
3.1. Data collection and study sample
167 undergraduate students enrolled in a business statistics course over one semester
participated in this study. Students belonged to 4 different sections, taught by 2 different
instructors. All course sections used the same learning management system (LMS) and
had the same course structure in terms of content, schedule, assignments, and exams.
Of these four sections, two were offered in an online format. There were no significant
differences among the four sections with respect to the basic demographic composition.

dents to master the course content on their own, with on-campus meetings focused
exclusively on conducting exams. These exams were held on campus and proctored by
the instructor just like the face-to-face sections, thus removing any bias in that respect.
Out of the total of 167 students, 86 (51.5%) belonged to face-to-face sections and 81
(48.5%) to online sections, an almost equal representation from the two different
class formats.
Data on students’ background demographic and academic background were obtained
from the university’s office of institutional research, whereas data on the cognitive and
behavioral variables were obtained via a survey questionnaire that was posted as a link
on the course website (with IRB approval). Out of the total of 167 students, 128 volun-
tarily completed this survey yielding a response rate of 76.7%. The sample size for our
analyses was thusn ¼ 128.
3.2. Measures
We assessed personality traits, help-seeking behavior, learning styles, motivational styles,
goal orientations, meta-cognitive strategies, procrastination, academic self-concept, and
class performance as the main predictor variables in this study. Data on students’ per-
sonality traits were collected using the 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI) model
(Goldberg 1992; Saucier and Goldberg1996). The responses to the item questions fol-
lowed a 7-point Likert scale with the following categories: 1 ¼ strongly disagree,
7 ¼ strongly agree. Extraversion was measured using 8 item questions from the inven-
tory (3 with reversed scales), one representative question being“I see myself as someone
who is talkative ”. Agreeableness was measured using 9 questions (4 with reversed
scales), one typical question being“I see myself as someone who is helpful and unselfish
with others”. Conscientiousness was measured using 9 questions (4 with reversed scales),
a typical question being“I see myself as someone who does a thorough job”. Neuroticism
was measured using 8 questions (with reversed scales for 3 questions), a representative
question was “I see myself as someone who can be moody.” Finally, openness was meas-
ured with responses to 10 questions (2 with reversed scales) and a typical question for
this trait was “I see myself as someone who is original and comes up with new ideas”.
The final value for each of the five personality traits for each student was obtained by
averaging the responses to the individual questions (after considering the reversed scales
for the relevant questions), thus yielding a quantitative or continuous variable for
our models.
Following Ames and Lau (1982), we devised a 6-item Likert scale with responses on a
5-point scale (1¼ strongly disagree, 5¼ strongly agree) in order to assess individual dif-
ferences in help-seeking behavior. The items, which are listed below, were designed to
measure students’ perceptions of threat in seeking help from both personal and public
sources (others, professors): (a) Even if I have trouble learning the material in this class,
I try to do the work on my own, without help from anyone; (b) I ask the instructor to
clarify concepts I don’t understand well; (c) When I can’t understand the material in
this course, I ask another student in this class for help; (d) I try to identify students in
this class whom I can ask for help if necessary; (e) I try to take advantage of resources

class, my teachers and peers will think negatively about me.
Learning styles of students were measured with a short form of Kolb’s learning style
inventory (Kolb 1981; 1986) – 7 items for reflective observation and active experimenta-
tion (ROAE), and 5 items each for abstract conceptualization (AC) and concrete experi-
ence (CE). An example from ROAE scale is“when I learn, I like to think about ideas.”
An example from the AC scale is“I learn best when I trust my hunches and feelings”,
and one from the CE scale is“when I learn, I like to watch and listen.” All scales used
5 points (1 ¼ strongly disagree, 5 ¼ strongly agree). We measured motivational style
with 8 items from the self-regulated learning scale (Black and Deci2000; Ryan and Deci
2000), four of which focus on autonomous motivation (AUTREG) and four on con-
trolled motivation (CONREG). An example from the autonomous scale is“I would like
to participate actively in class because a solid understanding of statistics is important to
my intellectual growth”, while an example from the controlled scale is“I would like to
actively participate in class because I would feel proud of myself if I did well in the
course” (1 ¼ strongly disagree, 5¼ strongly agree).
We measured goal orientations using a seven-point scale (1¼ not at all true of me,
7 ¼ very true of me) consisting of 12 items and four subscales with three items each to
assess learning approach goals (LGO), learning avoid goals (LAGO), performance
approach goals (PGO), and performance avoid goals (PAGO) (Elliot and McGregor
2001). An example learning approach goal item is“I want to learn as much as possible
from this class”. For the learning avoid goal, an example question is“I worry that I
may not learn all that I possibly could in this class.” A performance approach goal
example question is “it is important for me to do better than other students” while a
performance avoid goal example is“I just want to avoid doing poorly in this class”.
Intrinsic value (INTRVAL) consisted of a nine-item scale, an example question being
“I like what I’m learning in this class.” We measured procrastination (PROC) using 6
items from the 16-item Tuckman procrastination scale (Tuckman1991) with a sample
question being “when I have a deadline, I wait till the last minute”. For the latter two
variables, the same scale as before was used (1¼ strongly disagree, 5
¼ strongly agree).
Academic self-concept was measured using three different questions to understand
differences among student’s self-perceptions about their ability to attain academic suc-
cess – (i) “what is your level of interest and motivation in this course” which was meas-
ured using a 5-point Likert scale (1¼ not interested, 5¼ very interested), (ii) “what is
your level of self-confidence in your overall intellectual ability in mathematics and
quantitative courses in general”, measured using a 5 point Likert scale (1¼ very low,
5 ¼ very high), and (iii) “how academically prepared do you think you were at the
beginning of the course ” measured using a 3-point scale (1 ¼ not prepared,
2 ¼ somewhat prepared but lacking important skills and knowledge, 3¼ well-prepared).
Lastly, we describe the response variables. Class performance was measured as a con-

class, my teachers and peers will think negatively about me.
Learning styles of students were measured with a short form of Kolb’s learning style
inventory – 7 items for reflective observation and active experimenta-
tion (ROAE), and 5 items each for abstract conceptualization (AC) and concrete experi-
ence (CE). An example from ROAE scale is“when I learn, I like to think about ideas.”
An example from the AC scale is“I learn best when I trust my hunches and feelings”,
and one from the CE scale is“when I learn, I like to watch and listen.” All scales used
5 points (1 ¼ strongly disagree, 5 ¼ strongly agree). We measured motivational style
with 8 items from the self-regulated learning scale, four of which focus on autonomous motivation (AUTREG) and four on con-
trolled motivation (CONREG). An example from the autonomous scale is“I would like
to participate actively in class because a solid understanding of statistics is important to
my intellectual growth”, while an example from the controlled scale is“I would like to
actively participate in class because I would feel proud of myself if I did well in the
course” (1 ¼ strongly disagree, 5¼ strongly agree).
We measured goal orientations using a seven-point scale (1¼ not at all true of me,
7 ¼ very true of me) consisting of 12 items and four subscales with three items each to
assess learning approach goals (LGO), learning avoid goals (LAGO), performance
approach goals (PGO), and performance avoid goals (PAGO). An example learning approach goal item is“I want to learn as much as possible
from this class”. For the learning avoid goal, an example question is“I worry that I
may not learn all that I possibly could in this class.” A performance approach goal
example question is “it is important for me to do better than other students” while a
performance avoid goal example is“I just want to avoid doing poorly in this class”.
Intrinsic value (INTRVAL) consisted of a nine-item scale, an example question being
“I like what I’m learning in this class.” We measured procrastination (PROC) using 6
items from the 16-item Tuckman procrastination scale with a sample
question being “when I have a deadline, I wait till the last minute”. For the latter two
variables, the same scale as before was used (1¼ strongly disagree, 5
¼ strongly agree).
Academic self-concept was measured using three different questions to understand
differences among student’s self-perceptions about their ability to attain academic suc-
cess – (i) “what is your level of interest and motivation in this course” which was meas-
ured using a 5-point Likert scale (1¼ not interested, 5¼ very interested), (ii) “what is
your level of self-confidence in your overall intellectual ability in mathematics and
quantitative courses in general”, measured using a 5 point Likert scale (1¼ very low,
5 ¼ very high), and (iii) “how academically prepared do you think you were at the
beginning of the course ” measured using a 3-point scale (1 ¼ not prepared,
2 ¼ somewhat prepared but lacking important skills and knowledge, 3¼ well-prepared).
Lastly, we describe the response variables. Class performance was measured as a con-
tinuous variable based on the final course grade for each student, measured on a stand-
ard percentage grading scale (0 to 100). Students’ success was measured by a binary
variable which assumed the value 1 for a student who obtained a letter grade of C or
above in the course, and the value 0 for a student who obtained a grade lower than C
or dropped/withdrew from the course. We call this variable PASS. Students’ propensity"
Mitra and Le - 2022 - The effect of cognitive and behavioral factors on student success in a bottleneck business statistic.pdf,"to take advantage of campus resources to improve performance in difficult courses is
measured by participation in Supplemental Instruction (SI) sessions. Since the benefits
of SI is not fully realized if a student only attends them a couple of times (typically just
before exams), we measure consistent participation as attending at least 3 sessions dur-
ing a semester. We call this variable“SI attend”.S o “SI attend” takes the value 1 for a
student who attends 3 or more SI sessions during a semester, and the value 0 otherwise.
All measurement scales demonstrated adequate reliability (a >.80).
Control variables included gender (1¼ female, 2¼ male), ethnicity (categories: White,
Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, International, Others), first generational college status
(1 ¼ Yes, 0 ¼ No), transfer status (1 ¼ first time freshman, 2 ¼ transfer student), class
format (0¼ traditional face-to-face; 1¼ online), self-reported GPA, and age (the last two
included as continuous variables).
3.3. Analysis and methods
Descriptive statistics are computed first in order to summarize the distribution of the
main study and control variables, frequency distributions for the categorical variables
and means and standard deviations for continuous variables. A correlation analysis was
also performed to assess the level of association among the different study variables to
determine potential multicollinearity issues. Some graphical representations are also
used to visualize the pattern of distribution of certain variables, particular those exhibit-
ing trends over time.
In order to identify the variables that affect students’ chances of success in this bottle-
neck course and in order to determine variables that have an effect on students’ consist-
ent participation in SI sessions during a semester, we usedlogistic regression (Hosmer
and Lemeshow 2000). For the success model, the binary variable PASS is used as the
dependent or response variable, while for the SI participation model we use“SI attend”
as the dependent variable. The individual test statistic used to test for the significance of
each coefficient in logistic regression models is called the“Wald” statistic and has a chi-
square distribution with one degree of freedom.
Quantile regression (QR) is a statistical technique that is used to estimate and conduct
inference about quantile function as opposed to means that are modeled in multiple lin-
ear regression (Koenker and Hallock2001). This type of regression is commonly used
in econometrics applications. The main advantage of quantile regression over linear
regression is that it provides the ability to model the entire family of quantile functions
from in the distribution of the response variable (instead of a single mean), thus yield-
ing a more comprehensive statistical analysis of the relationships among different varia-
bles. In this study we use quantile regression to determine the specific groups of factors
that affect student performance in this bottleneck course for different groups of students
such as, low-performing, high-performing, and so on. These student groups are repre-
sented by the quantiles of the distribution of the final grades in this course. Thus, the
insights obtained from these models will yield an understanding of which factors par-
ticularly are the most relevant in determining success for low-performing students,
which is important for the purpose of devising intervention and support services to pro-
vide additional to those students to help them be successful.

based on the factors identified earlier via the logistic regression and quantile regression
models, and the best predictive model in each case is selected as the one that has the
lowest Akaike’s Information Criterion or AIC value (Anderson2008). The accuracies of
the classification models are evaluated using two types of cross-validation methods.
First, we divide the entire dataset into a training set (65%) and a test or validation set
(35%). The random partition is repeated 20 times in order to remove selection bias, and
the final model accuracies are computed by averaging over the results from the various
repetitions. Second, we use the leave-one-out (LOO) method whereby the classifier is
trained on all the data except for one record which is used for testing. This is repeated
for all data records and the final model accuracies are averaged over all the repetitions.
The classification results are presented as the overall misclassification error rates (%)
calculated on the test sets in both cases.
However, for both of our models, the datasets are somewhat unbalanced since the
classification categories are not approximately equally represented. For the student suc-
cess model, the number of students who failed is significantly lower than those who
passed, and for the SI attendance model, the number of students attending SI sessions
consistently during a semester is also considerably low. We thus decided to employ an

ance in datasets. This is because the classifier is often not able to learn the characteris-
tics of the class which has relatively fewer observations (called “rare” or “minority”
class) as well as it does for the other class with a large number of observations (called
“majority” class), thus leading to poor classification outcomes for new test data belong-
ing to the rare class. This results in low F

thus to employ SMOTE to obtain a relatively“balanced” sample for each of our predict-
ive models using the same classifiers. Accuracies of the models are computed in each
case via both the LOO and training/test set methods.

1. Nearly 54% of the students enrolled in these classes are men and 76% are transfer
students. Regarding ethnic composition, we saw almost equal proportion of Asian,
White and Hispanic students. Moreover, about 24% of students are first generational
college students. Of the 128 students, 51% were enrolled in the two online sections and
49% in the two traditional face-to-face sections. The average (self-reported) GPA of
these students who participated was 3.15. The average age of the student participants
was 22.5 years.
The means and standard deviations of the different cognitive and motivational varia-
bles, personality traits, and academic self-concept are included inTable 2, and those of
the outcome variables (grades, SI attendance) appear inTable 3. Of the 128 students,
89% passed the course whereas 11% did not. Further, 16.4% attended at least one SI ses-
sion during the semester.

the entire course of the semester (16 weeks). It is clearly seen that the weeks around
examination times have prominent spikes (Weeks 5– 6, Week 12, Week 16). The overall
average mean number of LMS visits for all students is 25.51, while that for online
classes alone is 26.83 and face-to-face classes is 24.26. The online class engagement is
slightly higher than face-to-face as expected, however the difference is not statistically
significant at the 5% level (p ¼ 0.153).
Initial exploratory analyses revealed that a few of the background variables like ethni-

helped somewhat reduce the complexity of our models that already contained a large
number of study variables.
4.1. Quantile regression models
The dependent or outcome variable used for the quantile regression models is the final
course grades (continuous variable). We used the quantiles 0.2 to 0.8 to represent the
overall spectrum of performance, from low-performing (lower quantiles) to high-
performing (higher quantiles) students, and thereby study the effects of different factors
on these different sub-groups.
Bivariate correlations among some of the cognitive and behavioral variables were
found to be significant, which were: (i) CE and ROAE (r ¼ 0.68), (ii) AC and ROAE
(r ¼ 0.83), (iii) PROC and conscientiousness (r ¼/C0 0.61), (iv) AUTREG and INTRVAL
(r ¼ 0.72), (v) LGO and AUTREG (r ¼ 0.62), and (vi) LGO and INTRVAL (r ¼ 0.61).
Hence Variance Inflation Factors (or, VIFs) were used to examine multicollinearity
issues, the correlation among the predictor variables, in the models (Kutner,
Nachtsheim, and Neter2004; Sheather 2009) that is known to adversely affect regression
results. VIF is an index that measures the severity of multicollinearity, and the square-root
of VIF for a certain independent variable can be interpreted as the extent to which the
standard error of the model is inflated due to correlations with other independent variables
in the model. None of the VIFs for our study variables exceeded 3.5 (typical threshold used
is 5), hence none of them was eliminated on account of multicollinearity.
The model results are shown in Table 4. They show the p-values of the different
predictor variables for the seven different quantile regression models. Due to space
constraints, we do not include the detailed model output for the seven models. The

nificant effects on a student’s probability of passing this course. Finally, the variable repre-
senting learning analytics of students did not appear to be a significant predictor of student
success for this course as it was not even included in the final predictive model.
The odds ratio, furthermore, helps explain the nature of association of the outcome
variable with each of the significant predictor variables in the final model. For instance,
students with higher levels of autonomous regulation, those whose goal in class is
geared more toward performance (that is, performing well in the course is the main
goal as opposed to learning) and those who possess a learning style which is based on
hands-on and concrete experience are expected to have a significantly higher probability
of passing the course. Similarly, students who possess a higher degree of extraversion
(that is, have a personality which is more outgoing and social) have a higher chance of
being successful in this course. On the other hand, students with higher level of aca-
demic self-concept have a significantly lower probability of passing the course than
those who have lower levels of self-concept. The latter finding implies that students
who perceive to have more interest in the course, more self-confidence in their own
intellectual ability and believe they are more well-prepared for the course with the
requisite skills are more likely to fail the course. This shows that sometimes there is a
disconnect between students’ own perception of their own abilities and expectation of
performance in a course and their actual performance.
4.3. Logistic regression model for utilizing help and support (SI participation)
For studying students’ propensity to utilize additional resources as a means of support in
their course, we used “SI attend” as our outcome or dependent variable in the logistic
regression model that was introduced earlier. Just as with the model for student success,
several models were tested in this case also with different subsets of variables and the best
predictive model was selected based on the AIC value.Table 6 shows the model output.
We see that the cognitive and behavioral variables that have a statistically significant effect
on consistent SI attendance are help-seeking, controlled regulation (CONREG), and learn-
ing approach goal (LGO), allp-values being less than 0.05. Among the personality traits,
openness has a significant effect on determining whether a student will attend SI sessions.

because individuals who are more open-minded are expected to be more willing to try
new things (like SI, for example) than those who are less open. However, some of these
students may have experienced SI in previous courses and hence they may have been

4.4. Classification results from the two predictive models
Next, we assessed the predictive accuracy of the two predictive models via the two
cross-validation methods described earlier. The results using a cutoff probability of 0.50
for classification on the test set are shown inTable 7. The logistic regression model for
student success yielded error rates of 4.95% for the training/test method (45 records
included in the test set) and 10.2% for the LOO method. We compared these results
with other classification techniques such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, and RF
(built using an ensemble of 1000 decision trees) and these results are also included in
Table 7. So, although LOO is expected to be more efficient for smaller datasets, the
training/test method yielded higher accuracies for logistic regression and Naïve Bayes
(p <0.0001). For the other three methods (SVM, Decision Trees and RF), there was no
statistically significant difference between the two sets of results at the 5% level
(p ¼ 0.10, 0.11, 0.08 respectively). Further, the results also showed clearly that logistic
regression using the training/test method outperforms the other methods significantly
in this case (p ¼ 0.01 for SVM,p <0.0001 for Naïve Bayes, RF and Decision Trees).
On the other hand, the results from the two validation methods were not significantly
different for the consistent SI participation model for all the classifiers (p ¼ 0.19, 0.07, 0.59,

duced by Naïve Bayes and Random Forests (4.72% for both) for the LOO method
although they were not significantly different from that of the logistic regression model
using the training/test method which was 4.85% (p ¼ 0.97 in both cases). Moreover, the
low standard deviations in each case (1– 1.3%) showed that the results were fairly consist-
ent across different repetitions for each cross-validation method and are hence reliable.
Thus, although both models proved to demonstrate considerable accuracy in predict-
ing future outcomes (> 95%) and can be valuable in practical applications, the imbal-
ance in our datasets implied that a new test record was more likely to get classified as
belonging to the“majority” class than the“rare” class. Hence, we calculated F
1 scores to
accompany the error rates reported earlier. These scores provide a means to assess the
accuracy of a test by considering both precision and recall (Powers2011). The F
1 scores
for the logistic regression models (shown inTable 9) based on the training/test valid-
ation method proved to be optimal in each case; that is, they were the highest among
all the classifiers (0.40 and 0.67 for the student success and SI attendance models
respectively). However, these values were quite low.
Table 10 shows the results of applying the technique of SMOTE by over-sampling at
500% to partially obviate the issue of data imbalance in our study for both models. Logistic
regression yielded the best results, which we report here. For the student success model, the
error rates were 8.5% for both the LOO and the training/test set methods. Although this
value was significantly higher than those obtained earlier (p <0.0001) in a statistical sense,
the F
1 scores were significantly higher– 0.93 and 0.98 for the two methods. For the SI
attendance model, the error rates obtained were 1.3% and 3.4% respectively for LOO and
training/test set method using logistic regression. These values are significantly lower than
our previous results (p <0.0001 in both cases). The F
1 scores were also over 0.90 for all
cases. Thus, the SMOTE technique not only helped us improve the F1 scores but also
enhance the prediction accuracy for one of the models significantly. We henceforth choose
the logistic regression model with the training/test set validation method as our optimal
student success model and the logistic regression model with SMOTE using the LOO
method as the optimal SI attendance model.

Mitra and Le - 2022 - The effect of cognitive and behavioral factors on student success in a bottleneck business statistic.pdf,"attend SI consistently, shows that students who are not familiar with SI are not likely to
try it out, rather those who have some level of familiarity with it through earlier courses
tend to keep attending these sessions. This, in turn, seems to indicate that generally stu-
dents are satisfied with their SI experience and realize its benefits in terms of improved
learning and performance and hence are more likely to put in the extra effort to take
advantage of it whenever they are available for a course. On the other hand, it is
expected that students who are focused on learning well in the course (and not just on
passing the course) will attend SI session more frequently because SI provides them
with the opportunity to reinforce the materials learned in their classes, thus resulting in
a better overall learning experience for the course. Finally, students who are more likely
to seek help also naturally were found to be more inclined toward attending SI sessions,
a result which is consistent with expectations.
Regarding factors that affect student success in this course most significantly in our
predictive model, students who have higher levels of autonomous regulation, who are
have performance-oriented goals and those who prefer a learning style that is based on
concrete hands-on experience, are expected to have a higher chance of success in the
course. Students who have greater autonomous regulation are typically more organized
and have greater motivation (Black and Deci2000) and hence are expected to put more
effort in their courses and thus perform well. Similarly, students who rely on more
hands-on experiences are likely to engage in more problem-solving which form the
basis of a quantitative course like this one, and hence will probably perform better and
have higher chances of successfully completing the course. In terms of goal orientations,
students who have a more performance-oriented goal also are expected to put in more
hard work to achieve their aim of performing well in the course. This is very interest-
ing, because our earlier finding showed that students who have a more learning-focused
goal (instead of a performance-focused one) are more likely to utilize additional resour-
ces to support their learning. Among the five primary personality traits studied here,
students who are more social and have a positive outlook (that is, possess a higher
degree of “extraversion”) are likely to succeed in this course. This result aligns well with
findings in earlier studies (Komarraju and Karau2005) that have found a positive rela-
tionship between extraversion and academic achievement. Lastly, students with higher
levels of academic self-concept were found to have a lower chance of succeeding in the
course. Such students usually believe that they have higher confidence in their own
intellectual abilities and level of preparedness; however, this does not reflect in their
actual performance in the course. This is a phenomenon that has been visible before in
several aspects, most prominently in technology usage, and shows that individuals often
do not have an accurate perception of their true understanding and abilities. In fact, in
psychology, the Dunning-Kruger effect describes a cognitive bias in which people of low
ability often mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it actually is
(Kruger and Dunning 1999). It is indeed very interesting to note that how certain
behavior and attitudes of people remain consistent across different applications and in
different aspects of life.
An important contribution of this work is identifying the subset of factors that specif-
ically impact the performance of low-performing students who are at a greater risk of
failing the course. Given the diverse nature of student populations, it is reasonable to

try it out, rather those who have some level of familiarity with it through earlier courses
tend to keep attending these sessions. This, in turn, seems to indicate that generally stu-
dents are satisfied with their SI experience and realize its benefits in terms of improved
learning and performance and hence are more likely to put in the extra effort to take
advantage of it whenever they are available for a course. On the other hand, it is
expected that students who are focused on learning well in the course (and not just on
passing the course) will attend SI session more frequently because SI provides them
with the opportunity to reinforce the materials learned in their classes, thus resulting in
a better overall learning experience for the course. Finally, students who are more likely
to seek help also naturally were found to be more inclined toward attending SI sessions,
a result which is consistent with expectations.
Regarding factors that affect student success in this course most significantly in our
predictive model, students who have higher levels of autonomous regulation, who are
have performance-oriented goals and those who prefer a learning style that is based on
concrete hands-on experience, are expected to have a higher chance of success in the
course. Students who have greater autonomous regulation are typically more organized
and have greater motivation and hence are expected to put more
effort in their courses and thus perform well. Similarly, students who rely on more
hands-on experiences are likely to engage in more problem-solving which form the
basis of a quantitative course like this one, and hence will probably perform better and
have higher chances of successfully completing the course. In terms of goal orientations,
students who have a more performance-oriented goal also are expected to put in more
hard work to achieve their aim of performing well in the course. This is very interest-
ing, because our earlier finding showed that students who have a more learning-focused

Mitra and Le - 2022 - The effect of cognitive and behavioral factors on student success in a bottleneck business statistic.pdf,"assume that different factors may play a role in determining success of high and low-
performing students. Indeed, we found that several cognitive factors such as intrinsic
value and self-regulation play a greater role in low-performing student performance,
and such insights can be extremely beneficial in developing targeted resources for
such students.
Learning analytics or students’ engagement behavior and pattern with their LMS did
not appear to be a strong predictor of either student success or of help-seeking behavior
in terms of SI attendance. Although some existing research (Yu and Jo2014) suggest
that students who are more engaged in the course are likely to perform well, we did not
observe this as one of the most significant factors in the presence of stronger factors
representing a student’s cognitive, behavioral traits as well as personality characteristics.
Even the correlation coefficient between students’ average LMS visits and their final
course grades was only 0.10 (not statistically significant), this leading to the conclusion
that this variable did not have any association with student success in the course.
5.1. Practical implications
Knowledge about underlying factors that significantly contribute toward different
aspects of student success in a bottleneck course is extremely valuable to educators and
administrators of higher education where the current focus is increasing on-time gradu-
ation rates, mainly for undergraduate students. This is because such findings and
insights provide in-depth understanding of the type of targeted intervention and sup-
port that can be designed and implemented for such a diverse student population as
served by our institution. For instance, efforts may be undertaken to encourage and
motivate students who are not likely to utilize additional support services to do so via
strategies like email reminders, incentives from instructors, and so on. Moreover,
instructors can take into account the different motivational styles and learning styles
that characterize their students to improve upon the design and delivery of courses in a
way that facilitates learning in a wider student subpopulation.
Additionally, knowledge about factors specific to the success of low-performing stu-
dents can be used by education administrators to develop resources and programs to
discuss skills (such as, setting specific learning goals, developing certain learning styles
that boost motivation, self-regulation, and so on) before they begin their degree pro-
gram that are likely to help them achieve successful outcomes and eventually graduate
on time. Many students entering college do not possess these skills that often are associ-
ated with poor performance, hence they will benefit significantly.
Finally, our study can be replicated for any course in any discipline, bottleneck or
not, and hence has far-reaching impacts for the general higher educational system in
terms of boosting student graduation rates.

lence of one of the outcomes used in classifications also affected their validity as is evi-
dent by the low F1 score for the student success model. This issue was addressed in the
case of the SI attendance model by employing the SMOTE technique; however, we hope
to collect additional data and explore other statistical modeling techniques and methods
in the near future to further improve our student success model. Another potential limi-
tation is the scope for generalizability of our results. Although the demographic com-
position of our sample closely represents that of the entire student population at our
university, it is probably not reasonable to make general inferences about all students
due to the restricted sample size. However, our study design is quite general and can be
used as a model to adapt for student success studies in other disciplines, especially for
bottleneck courses in such disciplines, and also at other educational institutions in the
region and nationwide.
5.3. Conclusions and future work
Our study yielded interesting and useful insights about the academic performance of
students in a bottleneck Business course at a large public university beyond just back-
ground demographic and academic factors that are traditionally studied. The study
included a diverse set of cognitive, behavioral and motivational factors, including learn-
ing analytics, and showed their importance in determining student success as well as in
understanding which of the students are likely to seek additional support services in
order to improve their performance in the course. In fact, it was very insightful to
observe how different sets of factors proved to be significant predictors for these two
phenomena studied here, both that are extremely crucial to overall academic achieve-
ment. A large-scale study like this thus has far-reaching impacts and the findings there-
from can be used broadly for developing appropriate intervention and support services
for students as well as targeted advising and mentoring guidelines so that students
receive the help they need to be successful in the course, and as a result, in complete
their degree requirements in a timely manner.
Our current and future direction of study include scaling the study to include more
students and extending to other bottleneck courses. Further, we will explore the oppor-
tunities for applying more sophisticated statistical models like hierarchical models and
mixed effects models to this data, especially those that are efficient for unbal-
anced datasets.
