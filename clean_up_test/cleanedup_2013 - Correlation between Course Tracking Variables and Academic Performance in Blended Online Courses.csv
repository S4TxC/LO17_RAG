Abstract—The purpose of this research was to identify which 
course tracking variables correlate significantly with academic 
performance in blended asynchronous online courses through 
an empirical analysis of Learning Management System (LMS) 
data. In this study, course tracking variables refers to number 
of online sessions, number of original posts created, number of 
follow-up posts created, number of content pages viewed and 
number of posts read. Academic performance defined as how 
well a student’s final grad is. These five variables were 
collected from 15 undergraduate courses in the first semester 
of academic year 2012 at one national university in Taiwan. A 
total of 528 related final scores were transformed to z score 
and analyzed to investigate the correlation between course 
tracking variables and academic performance. A multiple 
regression analysis was used to evaluate how well course 
tracking variables measure predicted academic performance. 
Results indicated that approximately 16.4% of the variability 
in academic performance was accounted for by student’s 
course tracking variables measure, and three of the five 
variables were statistically significant.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 The vast majority of Taiwan universities have adopted 
learning management systems (LMS) to support students 
learning for years. At one national university in Taiwan for 
instance, approximately 10,000 students and 3,000 staff use 
the commercial LMS Wisdom Master 3 (WM3) as part of 
their daily course experience. Increasingly, these systems 
provide an essential infrastructure which mediates students’ 
access to learning resources and facilitates student-student 
and student-lecturer interaction. Additionally, these systems 
can provide sophisticated levels of institutional-wide data on 
areas of student demographics, academic performance, 
learning pathways, user engagement, online behavior, and 
development and participation within social networks. These 
data can also be used to promote practitioner reflection for 
professional development as well as identifying students 
who may require additional scaffolding and/or early learning 
support. 
According to the Sloan Consortium, over 1.9 million 
students took at least one online course during Fall 2003, 
and 81% of all U.S. institutions of higher education offered 
at least one fully online or blended course [1]. Considering 
the rapid growth in online education, a key concern of 
educators and the public is the quality and effectiveness of 
online learning [2], [3]; co nsequently, recent studies have 
emphasized the importance of evaluating student behavior 
online to better understand student learning and achievement 
in the virtual environment [2], [4]. In addition, previous 
studies have evaluated students’ engagement in online 
courses through an empirical analysis of student learning 
behavior and its relationship to persistence and achievement. 
However, there is rare research focusing on blended online 
course through an empirical analysis of LMS data. 
The campus-based classroom, where students and 
instructors meet face-to-face (F2F), is physically and 
psychologically different to the virtual classroom. LMS 
appears more suited to giving and storing information. F2F 
is for responding to or discussing information. As these tasks 
are complementary, the optimum solution would appear to 
use both LMS and F2F. This pedagogic combination of the 
virtual and the real classroom is called blended learning and 
is advocated by an increasing number of authors [5], [6]. 
The goal of the present study was to examine blended course 
tracking variables through the analysis of LMS data. 
Specifically, this research addressed: 
/g122 Which course tracking variables of LMS data 
correlate to academic performance in blended online 
courses? 
/g122 How accurately can measures of significant course 
tracking variables of LMS data predict academic 
performance in blended courses?

A. Higher education institutions (HEIs) Integrated Internet 
and communication technology (ICT) into teaching and 
learning 
Higher education institutions (HEIs) integrated ICT into 
teaching and learning rapidly in the past decade. The broad 
number of ICT tools now readily available within HEIs 
presents numerous pedagogical advantages to both educators 
and learners. However, a simple combination of hardware 
and software will not make integration naturally follow [7]. 
In addition, Integration of ICTs into teaching and learning 
has been driven by both pedagogical goals and the need for 
enhanced flexibility of content delivery and engagement 
with course materials. Learning management system (LMS) 
seems to meet the criterion. A LMS is an information system"
2013 - Correlation between Course Tracking Variables and Academic Performance in Blended Online Courses.pdf,"that facilitates e-Learning. HEIs are in creasingly adopting 
LMS and consequently the analytics of LMS data are 
coming more to the fore.  
With current LMSs ranking in the top 10 technologies 
for higher education [8], one of the most significant 
developments in the use of information technology (IT) in 
universities in the last decade has been the adoption of 
LMSs to support the teaching and learning process [9]. 
LMSs process, store and disseminate educational material 
and support administration and communication associated 
with teaching and learning. Most LMSs are the primary 
e-learning resources that bring together tools and materials 
to support learning. However, despite this ubiquity of LMS 
use, there has not been widespread change in pedagogic 
practice to take advantage of the functionality afforded by 
LMSs [10], [11]. Consistent with this, there has been very 
little analysis of the impact of LMSs on teaching or learning 
[9]. In order to take advantage of the potential associated 
with LMSs, research that addresses the role of LMSs in 
learning performance is needed. Through the analysis of 
LMS data, this study addressed the question of which 
tracking variables correlate significantly with learning 
performance. 
B. Mining LMS data 
LMSs capture and store large amounts of sophisticated 
user activity and interaction data. Course tracking variables 
include measures such as the number and duration of online 
sessions (student visits to the online course site), messages 
read or posted, and content p ages visited. Perhaps the most 
promising source of automatically gathered online learning 
data is the learning software itself, particularly the LMS. 
Since students typically log in to such systems, keeping 
track of users and sessions–a major hurdle in examining 
server logs [12]–is done automatically. In addition, many 
such systems gather a range of relatively high-level student 
data such as quiz grades and forum posts [13]. Importantly, 
this data may represent aspects of learner behavior that are 
difficult or impossible to apprehend by other means: study 
patterns, engagement, and degree and mode of participation 
in learning networks [14]. 
To date, some investigators have been able to access, 
analyze, visualize and interpret this data, and current LMSs 
offer some data reporting options. Recent studies have 
developed or identified the potential for LMS tracking data 
variables. Reference [15] examined student engagement in 
totally asynchronous online courses through an empirical 
analysis of student behavior online and its relationship to 
persistence and achie vement. They found approximately 
31% of the variability in achievement was accounted for by 
student participation measures, and three of the eight 
variables were statistically significant. Reference [16] 
revealed that cumulative course data logs are predictive of 
both a student's sense of connectedness and student 
community in online courses. Reference [17] affirms that 
pedagogically meaningful information can be extracted from 
LMS-generated student tracking data, and discusses how 
these findings are informing the development of a 
customizable dashboard-like reporting tool for educators that 
will extract and visualize real-time data on student 
engagement and likelihood of success. 
However, Most of the existing studies track LMS data 
in fully online courses. A recent survey of United States (US) 
higher education institutions indicated a greater than 70% 
adoption rate of campus-wide LMS (Campus Computing 
Project, 2008). 2007 figures for the US suggest that greater 
than 3.9 million students (>20% of all US higher education 
students) enrolled in at least one online course during the 
Fall 2007 term [1]. Even more significant is the uptake of 
LMS to support ‘traditional’  classroom-based courses, in 
formats better described as ‘blended’ or ‘web-supported’. 
LMS is a heavily utilized tool and a critical resource for 
supporting teaching and learning across the institution. 
Moreover, very little research exists, and no guidance is 
available for educators, to indicate which (if any) of the 
captured tracking variables may be pedagogically 
meaningful – that is to say, which of the many available data 
points are indicative of student participation in educationally 
purposeful activity that may contribute to their learning and 
performance in a blended online course. 
C. Academic analytics 
Initially developed in the corporate sector as ‘business 
intelligence’, [18] have called the application of these 
analytical tools and processes to educational systems 
academic analytics. In essence, academic analytics involves 
the extraction of large volumes of data from institutional 
databases and the application of various statistical 
techniques in order to identify patterns and correlations [19]. 
The concept of ‘academic analytics’ is now gaining 
increasing momentum as a process for providing HEIs with 
the data necessary to respond to the reportage and decision 
making challenges facing contemporary universities [15]. 
For example, using analyses on student demographics, 
student learning styles, course communication and external 
factors, [20] suggested that Web-based courses are more 
attractive to busy students who are also more likely to fail or 
drop the course. In addition, [19] have proposed that the 
analysis of data captured from various IT systems could be 
used to inform decision making process for university 
management and administration. The new millennium has, 
however, seen the emergence of a new approach to 
system-wide data harvesting and analysis that has the 
potential to unlock the value of the vast data sets captured by 
institutional LMS. Reference [21] outlined how academic 
analytics can be used to better inform institutions about their 
students learning support needs. They also provided 
examples of IT automation that may allow for student 
user-information to be translated into a personalized and 
semi-automated support system for students. 
The widespread adoption of ICT across the HEIs has 
provided institutions with additional expansive data sets that 
capture student learning behaviors through user online 
interactions. However, there has been limited interest in 
analytics within the academy [18]. The few projects 
undertaken within the higher education sector have primarily 
focused on the analysis of institutionally-collected data on

existing studies analyzed only in fully online courses, 
regardless of the majority fraction of blended online courses. 
Through an empirical analysis of LMS data, this study 
aimed to identify which course tracking variables correlate 
significantly with academi c performance in blended 
asynchronous online courses. 
III. METHODOLOGY 
Initial exploratory research was undertaken to identify 
the course tracking variables that would inform the 
development of an academic analytics tool for institutions. 
This involved the mining of five LMS course tracking 
variables of the commercial LMS Wisdom Master 3 (WM3) 
at one national university in Taiwan. 
A. Study population and context 
This paper reports on the analysis of the commercial 
LMS tracking data from one semester of fifteen blended 
courses offered by one national university in Taiwan from 
Feb., 2012 to July, 2012. A ‘blended’ course is defined as 
one in which partial content delivery, communication and 
assessment is carried out via the institutional LMS. In this 
study, a blended course is specifically defined as at least half 
of course hours were conducted with online. This 
comprehensive blended course makes extensive use of 
available tools to provide access to course content (content 
pages, learning modules, web links, self-assessment quizzes), 
promote student communication and engagement 
(discussion forums, chat), assess student learning (quizzes, 
assignments), and allow instructors and students to 
self-manage their learning (mail, calendar, grades, progress, 
announcements). In summary, there are 15 blended courses, 
including 528 related final scores. A total of 528 students 
participated in this study. They were primarily freshmen 
aged 18-20 years old, with a gender balance of males to 
females of 15:19. The 15 blended courses were equally 
spread around different colleges. 
B. Data collection and procedures 
The data analyzed in this exploratory research was 
extracted from the course-based tracking variables. Data in 
course tracking variables were stored in the selected 
commercial LMS database. The selected commercial LMS 
database had ten related tables which stored course tracking 
data for this study. The interface of database query tool such 
as phpMyAdmin provides SQL (Structured Query Language) 
to insert, query, update and delete course tracking variables 
data which stored in different tables. Using the 
phpMyAdmin, data were extracted a greater set of course 
tracking data and exported to CSV files. The procedures of 
finding out specific data were using SQL to query with 
different tables step by step under some conditions. 
Tables in a database were related to each other with keys. 
Through the JOIN function were used in an SQL statement 
to query data from two or more tables, based on a 
relationship between certain columns in these tables. Data 
collected on each student included ‘whole semester’ counts 
for frequency of usage of course materials, engagement and 
discussion. In some cases, variables were combined to give a 
more accurate and complete measure of post read. For 
instance, counts per student for ‘discussing board post read’ 
and ‘chat room post read’ were aggregated to provide a 
complete score for student read of post. Table 1 shows the 
initial set of course tracking variables examined in this study 
for relationship with student performance in the course. Data 
was exported into an Excel spreadsheet and merged with 
final course grade data received from institution 
administration database. The function of Excel was used to 
standardize each final score data as z scores. This complete 
student data set was later imported into SPSS for multiple 
regression analysis. Descriptive data for the initial set of 
course tracking variables are presented in Table 2.

A. Simple (bivariate) correlations of LMS tracking 
variables with final grade 
To further investigate the significance of selected 
variables as indicators of student performance in this study, 
a simple correlation analysis of each variable with student 
final grade was undertaken. Of the selected five course 
tracking variables examined, all of them demonstrate a 
positive and statistically significant correlation with student 
final grade (p < 0.01) (Table 3). Within the significant subset 
of the LMS variables, one demonstrate a medium-large 
effect size (r = 0.386), with explaining 15% of the variance 
in student final grade. The remaining 4 variables have a 
small-medium effect size (r = 0.146–0.278), with each 
explaining from 2% to 8% of variance in student final grade.

phpMyAdmin, data were extracted a greater set of course 
tracking data and exported to CSV files. The procedures of 
finding out specific data were using SQL to query with 
different tables step by step under some conditions. 
Tables in a database were related to each other with keys. 
Through the JOIN function were used in an SQL statement 
to query data from two or more tables, based on a 
relationship between certain columns in these tables. Data 
collected on each student included ‘whole semester’ counts 
for frequency of usage of course materials, engagement and 
discussion. In some cases, variables were combined to give a 
more accurate and complete measure of post read. For 
instance, counts per student for ‘discussing board post read’ 
and ‘chat room post read’ were aggregated to provide a 
complete score for student read of post. Table 1 shows the 
initial set of course tracking variables examined in this study 
for relationship with student performance in the course. Data 
was exported into an Excel spreadsheet and merged with 
final course grade data received from institution 
administration database. The function of Excel was used to 
standardize each final score data as z scores. This complete 
student data set was later imported into SPSS for multiple 
regression analysis. Descriptive data for the initial set of 
course tracking variables are presented in Table 2.

IV. RESULTS 
A. Simple (bivariate) correlations of LMS tracking 
variables with final grade 
To further investigate the significance of selected 
variables as indicators of student performance in this study, 
a simple correlation analysis of each variable with student 
final grade was undertaken. Of the selected five course 
tracking variables examined, all of them demonstrate a 
positive and statistically significant correlation with student 
final grade (p < 0.01) (Table 3). Within the significant subset 
of the LMS variables, one demonstrate a medium-large 
effect size (r = 0.386), with explaining 15% of the variance 
in student final grade. The remaining 4 variables have a 
small-medium effect size (r = 0.146–0.278), with each 
explaining from 2% to 8% of variance in student final grade.

B. Multiple regression 
Although five LMS variables for this study appeared to 
show significant correlation with student final grade, it 
would be erroneous to rely too heavily on the predictive 
power of simple correlations. Students do not show simple 
univariate patterns of blended online behavior within course 
websites, but instead undertake complex composite 
behaviors in which they make decisions to give more or less 
time to different activities. Some combinations of online 
activities are likely to translate into effective learning 
strategies but ‘more time spent on online activities’ does not 
simply predict higher performance. In other words, some 
students are making more effective strategic decisions about 
time use within the virtual classroom that is not adequately 
represented by simple correlations with time online. 
From the set of significantly correlated course tracking 
variables (Table 3), five potentially significant indicator 
variables were identified for inclusion in a multiple 
regression analysis. The previously identified predictors are 
entered into the model in order of their importance in 
determining the outcome variable [22]. However, in the 
absence of such information, a stepwise approach for 
entering potentially sig nificant variables into a model is a 
robust and valid approach. In these instances a forward or 
backward stepwise regression analysis is undertaken. 
However, a forward regression does present a higher risk in 
terms of excluding potential predictors that are involved in 
suppressor effects and thus may generate Type II errors (that 
is, accidentally excluding significant predictors) [22]. 
Consequently, this study elected to adopt a backwards 
stepwise method, in which variables that are not statistically 
significant in relation to the pr edictive power of the model 
are removed. 
A linear multiple regression analysis was therefore 
conducted, in order to develop a predictive model in which 
‘Student final grade’ was the continuous dependent variable. 
As shown in Table 4, this process generated a ‘best 
predictive model’ of student final grade (F (32.900), p = 
0.00) as a linear combination of the LMS tracking data 
variables measuring only three online activities: total 
number of online sessions, total number of follow-up posts 
created, and total number of posts read. All three variables 
are statistically significant contributors (p < 0.05). The 
multiple squared correlation coefficient for this model is 
0.164, indicating that some 16.4% of the variability in 
student performance in this study can be explained by this 
combination of student online activities within the course 
site.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
A. LMS data variables are significant indicators of 
student performance 
This study was conducted to analyze the five course 
tracking variables mined from LMS data in fifteen blended 
online courses over one semester. There were two research 
questions. The first was which course tracking variables of 
LMS data correlate to academic performance in blended 
online courses? A simple correlation analysis of variables 
indicated that the five variables were all correlated with 
student final grade which defined as student performance. 
The number of online session variable explained 15% of the 
variation in student final grade. Although the other four 
variables resulting the correlation were significant, but the 
variation was lower than 8%, from 2% to 8%. It meant that 
the major factor of influencing student performance in 
blended online course was the student total number of online 
session. 
The second research question was how accurately can 
measures of significant course tracking variables of LMS 
data predict academic performance in blended courses? Our 
findings indicated that a regression model of student 
performance, developed using course tracking variables 
relevant to the measures of time on task (variables indicating 
number of online session, number of follow-up posts created 
and number of posts read) explain ed 16.4% of the variation 
in student final grade. This regression model suggested that 
three measures of student online activity (number of online 
session, number of follow-up posts created and number of 
posts read) function as significant predictive variables of 
student final grade. However, while past studies have 
focused on ‘time online’ as a measure of student 
engagement and effort, our current investigation in blended 
online course indicated that number of post created and 
number of content viewed were not significant predictor 
variables of student final grade in regression model. The 
single most significant predictive variable reported here, 
with regression coefficient (£) of 0.414 is the total number 
of student online session. This result support and confirm 
that the degree of student engagement in an online course is 
an important indicator of academic performance. The other 
interesting findings were the regression coefficient of the 
other two significant predictive variables. The first is the 
total number of follow-up posts created, with only 
regression coefficient (£) of 0.132. One explanation is that 
the student’s interaction in blended online course not only 
happened in virtual classroom but also in F2F classroom. 
Another alternative is that neither the total number of 
original post created nor the total number of follow-up post 
created had any impact. One possible reason for the lack of 
the effect could be cultural. In Taiwan cultural context, 
students in blended course are used to interact with

The second interesting finding is the total number of post 
read indicated negative pr edictive variable, with regression 
coefficient ( £) of -0.152. There are several possibilities. 
The first of these is possibly the nature of student behavior 
in blended online course. It seems that students read more 
posts were less aggressive create posts themselves. A second 
possibility is probably that student behave less confident 
when read posts more than create posts in Taiwan 
e-Learning context. A third possibility is that the 
contribution of statistic significant was just too small. 
To sum up, simple bivariate regression indicated that 
all five selected course tracking variables correlated with the

Multiple regression analysis, however, indicated that only 
course tracking variable refer to total number of online

performance. The rest four course tracking variables either 
show no impact on final score, or with very little variation of 
academic performance. We concluded that in blended online 
course, the major factor influencing the student academic 
performance was the course tracking variable refers to total 
number of online session. 
B. Limitations of this study 
There are two limitations that impact the overall 
generalizability and interpretation of the findings of this 
study. First, the implications of the study are limited by its 
focus on data derived from blended online courses within 
one institution and one LMS. Second, in blended online 
courses, it is reasonable to expect that the proportion of F2F 
interaction will disturb the impact of interaction in virtual 
classroom. This suggests that indicators of student online 
activity maybe be over-estimated. Future studies should be 
directed towards the investigation and analysis of 
institutional-wide co urse tracking indicators, including 
virtual and F2F classroom, measure in relation to student 
academic performance for alternate pedagogical designs and 
course delivery modalities.
