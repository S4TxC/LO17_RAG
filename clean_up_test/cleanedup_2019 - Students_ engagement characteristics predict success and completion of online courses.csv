Abstract
This study examined students' engagement characteristics in online courses and their
impact on academic achievements, trying to distinguish between course completers
and noncompleters. Moreover, this research is intended to differentiate between
those who pass the final exam and those who do not. Four online courses were exam-
ined with a similar pedagogical model ( N
students = 646) using learning analytics
methods. The results revealed significant differences between students who com-
pleted the courses and students who did not, in all 13 variables. Completers' learning
activities were more than twice as high, except for writing in the forums. Course sub-
ject and ongoing task and assignment submissions predicted course completion,
whereas, in addition to these variables, engagement with course materials and reading
the forums predicted final exam success, as well. Thus, the prediction of success in
final exam emphasized the significant importance of engagement in various activities
in the online course.

1 | INTRODUCTION
In recent years, higher education institutions have been increasingly
developing and offering online courses as part of their academic cur-
riculum (Cohen & Soffer, 2015; Lee, 2016; Toven‐Lindsey, Rhoads, &
Lozano, 2015), providing access to a wide range of audiences and
improving teaching and learning processes (Macfadyen & Dawson,
2010; Roby, Ashe, Singh, & Clark, 2013). However, along with the
growing number of online courses, there is an increasing concern
regarding the students' persistence and engagement, as well as high
dropout rates, which reflected by very low activity (Kovanović et al.,
2016) compared with face‐to‐face courses (Clay, Rowland, & Packard,
2009; Otter et al., 2013). The dropout rate of online courses stands at
about 25–40%, whereas the dropout rate from academic courses,
which are held on campus, is about 10–20% (Cohen, 2017; Cheng,
Kulkarni, & Klemmer, 2013; Levy, 2007; Nistor & Neubauer, 2010;
Park & Choi, 2009). Moreover, previous studies indicated that lack
of persistence that is reflected in low engagement and poor self‐
regulation are important factors leading to attrition among students
in online courses and inadequate academic achievements (Angelino,
Williams, & Natvig, 2007; Otter et al., 2013; You, 2016). Therefore,
it essential to better understand the ways in which higher engagement
and self‐regulation among online learners influence the learning and
keep them motivated and participating in online course assignments.
In this context, the present study examined students' engagement
characteristics in online courses and their impact on academic
achievements, trying to distinguish between course completers and
noncompleters. Engagement in this study was examined by a large
scope of variables, which were derived from the students' activities
during their learning process in the course. Specifically, 13 variables
were divided into six main categories that portray the learning engage-
ment in regard to the course subject, learning materials, interpersonal
interaction, and assignments. Hence, students' engagement was
explored by analyzing the learning management system (LMS) log files

In recent years, higher education institutions have been increasingly

riculum, providing access to a wide range of audiences and
improving teaching and learning processes. However, along with the
growing number of online courses, there is an increasing concern

about the learners' behaviour and understand its impact on learning
persistence and online course completion. It should be noted that
previous studies that used log files derived from LMSs were mainly
concentrated on assessing students' activities in the online courses
by measuring variables such as time spent in reading pages, number
of content views, logins, video lecture views, as well as discussion
forum participation (Kahan, Soffer, & Nachmias, 2017; Khalil & Ebner,
2017). However, there have rarely been studies that have used log file
data to differentiate between students who complete a course
compared with the noncompleters, trying to identify engagement
characteristics that predict success or completion in online courses
(Agudo‐Peregrina, Iglesias ‐Pradas, Conde ‐González, & Hernández ‐
García, 2014; Ma, Han, Yang, & Cheng, 2015). Thus, the main goals
of this study were to examine the differences in students' engagement
by assessing those who have completed and those who have not
completed the online course and to explore the variables that may
predict success in online courses.
The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of
the characteristics of students' activities in online courses, which is
important for improving learning engagement and achievements as
well as completing the course. Additionally, these results could also
assist in evaluating the quality of online teaching and learning so as
to design suitable academic online courses. This could lead to the
implementation of support strategies for improving the quality of
online learning (Ma et al., 2015).
2 | BACKGROUND
In recent years, the discourse around online academic courses being
part of the curriculum for certification has renewed. Even though
online courses are not a new phenomenon (Mason, 1998), a rapid
growth in online academic courses has been seen recently in higher
education instititions as part of their long‐term strategies (Allen &
Seaman, 2015). Higher education institutions are developing and
offering online courses as part of their degree curriculums (Cohen &
Soffer, 2015; Toven‐Lindsey et al., 2015), providing access to a wide
range of audiences, and improving teaching and learning processes
(Macfadyen & Dawson, 2010; Roby et al., 2013). The considerations
for developing online courses are broad and derived from efficiency,
economic, organizational, pedagogical, and operational aspects (Bakia,
Shear, Toyama, & Lasseter, 2012; Massengale & Vasquez, 2016).
In online courses, as in any academic work, students' active
engagement affects their learning outcomes, cognitive development,
and educational quality (Soffer & Nachmias, 2018; Hew, 2016;
Smith, Sheppard, Johnson, & Johnson, 2005;). Previous studies dis-
cuss various aspects of engagement, for example, the effect of
LMS design factors on user engagement (Zanjani, Edwards, Nykvist,
& Geva, 2017); the influence of personal aspects on student engage-
ment (Jung & Lee, 2018; Pellas, 2014); and instructor scaffolding for
interaction (Cho & Cho, 2014). Yet hardly any have looked directly at
the impact of the course's pedagogical model on engagement (Khan,
Egbue, Palkie, & Madden, 2017). Furthermore, most of the previous
research is primarily based on questionnaires or surveys. Only a
few have used student activity data, which are collected automati-
cally in the LMS, to explore students' engagement.
2.1 | Students' engagement in online courses
Student engagement usually refers to the time and effort that
students devote to their academic experiences (Ma et al., 2015). In
previous research, it was found that students who had been actively
engaged in their academic work showed a high of level learning
outcomes. In other words, a significant relationship between active
participation in online courses and academic performance was found
(Hew, 2016; Macfadyen & Dawson, 2010; Romero, López, Luna, &
Ventura, 2013). When exploring students' engagement in online
courses, it is usually measured by students' activities in regard to three
distinct strands: engagement with course learning materials, interper-
sonal interaction among instructors and students, and performance
in tasks and assignments. In the next sections, we briefly describe
the work conducted in each strand.
2.2 | Students' engagement with course learning
materials
Online courses may offer an effective and enjoyable learning
environment if they are designed properly, in a way that emphasizes
interaction, clear structure, and strong content (Driscoll, Jicha, Hunt,
Tichavsky, & Thompson, 2012). Online courses can take advantage
of being able to offer course content through a wide range of up‐to‐
date and challenging web resources (e.g., text, audio, video lectures
and presentation slides). Some researchers claim that students
perceive the ease of access to varied, high quality, and up‐to‐date
learning materials as benefiting their learning in an online course
(Kahan et al., 2017; Palmer & Holt, 2010). Moreover, the course
content is a significant driver in students' perception of the quality
of the learning experience (Peltier, Schibrowsky, & Drago, 2007; Wu,
2016). In recent years, video is perceived as a rich and powerful
medium (Chen & Sun, 2012; Ozan & Ozarslan, 2016; Zhang, Zhou,
Briggs, & Nunamaker, 2006). Thus, a rich learning environment
contributes to the effectiveness of online learning (Crawford‐Ferre &
Wiest, 2012) and enables more time to be dedicated to learning
materials compared with classroom‐based learning (Robertson, Grant,
& Jackson, 2005). Furthermore, online learning provides more
autonomy and enabling students to learn at their own pace. It allows
flexibility in terms of time and location (Lim, 2016; Rodriguez, Rooms,
& Montañez, 2008).
Online learning environments must foster engagement with
learning materials (Sebastianelli & Tamimi, 2011). Organizing these
resources into learning units seems to help students to manage
their learning better and provides a clear and consistent structure
that was found to be related to higher levels of student satisfaction
(Kahan et al., 2017; Jones & Kelley, 2003; Paechter, Maier, &
Macher, 2010).

2019 - Students_ engagement characteristics predict success and completion of online courses.pdf,"2.3 | Interpersonal interaction in online courses
Communication is an important component in online courses, espe-
cially given the absence of physical meetings (Huang, Dasgupta,
Ghosh, Manning, & Sanders, 2014). Through interpersonal interaction
and information sharing, online courses enable collaborative learning
and contribute to significant knowledge acquisition (Bell, 2011;
Downes, 2007; Robinson, 2013; Siemens, 2014; Tee & Karney,
2010). The instructor usually initiates the forums and allows learners
to join the discussions and interact on a variety of issues related to
the subject (Akyol & Garrison, 2008; Chaturvedi, Goldwasser, &
Daumé III, 2014). The learners are exposed to ideas, opinions, and
comments from classmate. They contribute from their personal infor-
mation as well as acquire knowledge created in the forums
(Cacciamani, Cesareni, Martini, Ferrini, & Fujita, 2012). Moreover,
instructor‐student communication contains feedback regarding
students' activities and performance, and can be used to answer ques-
tions regarding subject matter (Sebastianelli, Swift, & Tamimi, 2015).
Interpersonal interaction among students and instructors is
strongly correlated with higher student engagement in a course
(Dixson, 2012) and motivates them to succeed (Jaggars & Xu, 2013).
This interaction has a significant and positive impact on student satis-
faction (Marks, Sibley, & Sher, 2005; Toven‐Lindsey et al., 2015),
although the absence of proper communication might lead to a sense
of isolation and a lack of sense of community (Song, Singleton, Hill, &
Koh, 2004). Therefore, communication should be carefully designed to
enable and promote interactions among instructors and students.
2.4 | Students' performance in online course
assignments
Assessment of student knowledge and understanding of subject mat-
ter is used to promote learning and to ensure that students meet the
intended learning outcomes. In online courses, assessment of learning
processes becomes crucial especially in light of the fact that it serves
as a means for increasing students' involvement and engagement
with the course materials (Planar & Moya, 2016). Assessment tools
assist the instructor in tracking and assessing students' knowledge
in order to provide feedback. This feedback enables the students
further guided engagement and the opportunity to revise the
assignments (Cramp, 2011). Notably, feedback on assignments is
important and must be given in a timely manner in order to keep
the learners involved and motivated (Hattie & Timperley, 2007;
Robertson et al., 2005).
Students in online courses are motivated when the instructors
provide clear objectives and requirements (Toven ‐Lindsey et al.,
2015) as well as specified assignments. Furthermore, it is essential to
incorporate deadlines that are valuable to students when designing
the course assignments. Deadlines help students avoid procrastina-
tion, encourage them to spend time on assignments, support them in
self‐regulation, and provide them with a context for regular contact
with their instructor and peers (Graham, Cagiltay, Lim, Craner, &
Duffy, 2001).
2.5 | Assessing student engagement through
learning analytics
Student engagement with learning materials and activities during an
online course are essential to the success of learning processes (Ma
et al., 2015); thus, various methodologies for assessing student activity
in these courses are developing. Some are based on online assign-
ments, quizzes, and tests (Brooks, Thompson, & Teasley, 2015;
Schiming, 2012). Some are based on learning analytics, which is the
analysis of students' learning activity data that accumulates in real
time in the weblog files of the LMS in which the fully online courses
are offered (Blikstein, 2011; Broadbent & Poon, 2015; Goda et al.,
2015; Johnson et al., 2013; McElroy & Lubich, 2013; Romero‐Zaldivar,
Pardo, Burgos, & Delgado Kloos, 2012). Hence, in recent years, we
have witnessed the growing use of learning analytics as a popular
method to analyse and assess students' behaviour and achievements
in online courses (Kahan et al., 2017; You, 2016). Thus, the online
learning environments, which use LMSs, enable the trace of students'
activities with regard to self‐regulated learning behaviour at any stage
of a course's progression for the evaluation of learning processes and
learner behaviour through formative as well as summative assessment.
The collective data could assist in monitoring the students' behaviour
and achievements during the online course, as well as identifying
differences among students in order to detect and even predict
dropout from the course (Cohen & Soffer, 2015; Lim, 2016).
Time and effort spent by students on online courses were found
to be factors that affect their achievement (Ryabov, 2012). Accessibil-
ity of learning materials, presence of the instructor, timely instructor
feedback, and the students' sense of community within an online
course were identified as essential for effective online instruction
(Cohen & Soffer, 2015; Roby et al., 2013; Romero et al., 2013; Zen,
2008). Thus, instructors may use the retrieved data and analyse it in
order (a) to learn about student involvement and performance, (b) to
improve instruction and assessment in real time, and (c) to adjust their
teaching styles to student needs. In addition, learning analytics make it
possible to track student usage of different parts of a website to have
a better understanding of learning processes, their effectiveness, and
their suitability for a learner.
Based on the research literature, an integrative research frame-
work was developed in order to predict students' success and comple-
tion of an online academic course (Figure 1). The framework of the
study includes 13 variables divided into six main categories that
characterize the learning engagement as well as students' success
and course completion. The learning engagement was measured by
students' activities in the online course in regard to the course
subject, learning materials, interpersonal interaction, and assignments
(learning outcomes). Students' engagement was explored by analysing
the LMS log files using learning analytics methods to predict success
and course completion.

3 | THE STUDY AIMS AND QUESTIONS
Because student engagement in online courses is a strong predictor of student success and achievement of learning outcomes, the aims"
2019 - Students_ engagement characteristics predict success and completion of online courses.pdf,"of this study are to explore the differences among students in regard
to their engagement in academic online courses and to predict vari-
ables that have an effect on completion or noncompletion of a course.
In this study, we distinguish between success on the final exam (grade)
and completion of the course because of course completion depends
on both the final exam grade and ongoing assignments throughout
the course.
In order to achieve these research aims, three main questions
were asked:
1. Are there significant differences between students who com-
pleted and did not complete the course with regard to engage-
ment with learning materials, interpersonal interaction, and
assignments?
2. What are the students' online activities that predict success on
the final exam?
3. What are the students' online activities that predict completion
versus noncompletion of the course?
4 | METHOD
4.1 | Research Field
In the academic year 2013/2014, the university decided to implement
a wide process of redesigning face‐to‐face courses into online courses.
The present study examined four redesigned online courses (N = 646)
that were offered during the academic year 2015/2016. These
courses are part of a special programme called“The Complementary
Studies Program.” The programme is intended for all undergraduate
students at the university and offers them the opportunity to study
subjects that interest them. The programme is mandatory for all
undergraduate students on campus and requires each student to take
at least three elected courses in fields that are polar opposite from
their degree programme during their 3 years of studies. Thus, each
course is characterized by a wide range of participants from various
disciplines and from different academic years (within their Bachelor
of Arts degree).
These four courses were selected because they were developed
based on the same pedagogical model and unified structure. In addi-
tion, all four were semester‐long courses, two credit hours each, and
had a large number of students (>150).
Because instructors' course preparation is significantly and posi-
tively related to the students' viewing activities (Jaggars & Xu, 2013),
a consistent instructional course model was designed and imple-
mented as part of the online course development for each of the four
courses, consisting of four main elements:
• Learning units that included 12 learning units that comprised the
core of the online course materials. Each learning unit covered a
different topic and consisted of a video lecture of the instructor,
a summary of the lecture, reading/viewing materials (e.g., articles,
original literary texts, and YouTube links), and assignments.
• Communication channels that included instructor‐to‐student dis-
cussion forums and student‐to‐student discussion forums.

4 | METHOD
4.1 | Research Field
In the academic year 2013/2014, the university decided to implement
a wide process of redesigning face‐to‐face courses into online courses.
The present study examined four redesigned online courses (N = 646)
that were offered during the academic year 2015/2016. These
courses are part of a special programme called“The Complementary
Studies Program.” The programme is intended for all undergraduate
students at the university and offers them the opportunity to study
subjects that interest them. The programme is mandatory for all
undergraduate students on campus and requires each student to take
at least three elected courses in fields that are polar opposite from
their degree programme during their 3 years of studies. Thus, each
course is characterized by a wide range of participants from various
disciplines and from different academic years (within their Bachelor
of Arts degree).
These four courses were selected because they were developed
based on the same pedagogical model and unified structure. In addi-
tion, all four were semester‐long courses, two credit hours each, and
had a large number of students (>150).
Because instructors' course preparation is significantly and posi-
tively related to the students' viewing activities (Jaggars & Xu, 2013),
a consistent instructional course model was designed and imple-
mented as part of the online course development for each of the four
courses, consisting of four main elements:
• Learning units that included 12 learning units that comprised the
core of the online course materials. Each learning unit covered a
different topic and consisted of a video lecture of the instructor,
a summary of the lecture, reading/viewing materials (e.g., articles,
original literary texts, and YouTube links), and assignments.
• Communication channels that included instructor‐to‐student dis-
cussion forums and student‐to‐student discussion forums."
2019 - Students_ engagement characteristics predict success and completion of online courses.pdf,"• Additional materials that were related to the course subject.
• General information about the course subject, its instructor, and
guidelines regarding learning in an online course.
4.2 | Participants and design
The study included data from the online activity of undergraduate stu-
dents (N = 646) who participated in the four online courses during the
academic year 2015/2016. The four online courses were delivered on
the Moodle LMS and were asynchronous. The first two courses were
studied in the humanities faculty: course A in the field of East Asian
studies; course B in the field of African studies. The third course,
course C, in the History of the Gaze in the Arts was studied in the
art faculty, and the fourth course subject, course D, the Cellular and
Molecular Basis of Cancer, was studied in the medicine faculty.
Table 1 presents the frequency of students who participated in
the online courses and their completion percentage: completed the
course or not. A student did not complete the course if he/she did
not have an average passing score for the ongoing assignments and
final exam or did not attend the final exam. It should be noted that
based on the course set‐up, a student can complete the course even
if he or she failed the final exam because the grade was composed
of weighting the assignment scores with the final exam. The majority
of students (74% on average) passed their course. In addition, as can
be seen, although students did not finish courses A, B, and C mainly
because they did not attend the final exam, the majority of students
who did not finish course D failed the final exam. In order to compare
the online activities of those students who completed the course and
those students who did not complete the course, we merged students
who did not have an average passing score for the ongoing assign-
ments and final exam grade, with students who did not attend the final
exam. This was due to the fact that students who did not attend the
final exam did not complete the course.
4.3 | Measures
The present study included 13 variables that represented the students'
activity in various elements of the courses (home page, learning units,
video lectures, assignment submissions, and forums) and their course
grades (assignments, final exam, and final course grade). Table 2 pre-
sents the study variables.
4.4 | Procedure
The study was conducted using learning analytics and statistical
methods. The data was collected from two sources: (a) the LMS, which
included log files with student activities and online assignment scores;
and (b) the exam grades and the final score in the course, which were
provided manually by the instructors. Data mining was applied on a log
data set, with over 188,510 records, where the LMS automatically
documented the students' activity during the courses. After the
courses ended, the data were retrieved and processed using SQL
queries. Following that, functions were written in order to compute
a set of variables, which described each student activity in the courses,
in regard to course homepage, learning units, video lectures, assign-
ment submissions, additional materials, and forums. Using SPSS‐23,
ANOVA analysis was applied to analyse the differences between
completers and noncompleters in regard to engagement in the
courses. In addition, two regression models were used to find the
predictor variables for completion and final exam grades: (a)
Logistic regression analysis was conducted in order to predict comple-
tion of the course based on online activity. Course subject was
entered in the first block. Because the percentage of noncompletion
was the lowest in course A, this course was selected as the reference
category for the calculated dummy variable for course subject. (b)

noted that prior to predicting students' exam grades, simple bivariate
correlations were examined between students' exam grades and their
online activity in their course.
5 | RESULTS
5.1 | Differences between students who completed
and did not complete the course in regard to their
online engagement
In order to examine the differences between students who completed
the courses and students who did not complete the courses in regard
to their online activities, eleven ANOVA analyses were conducted
(one for each of the dependent variables, separately), with completion
status (yes/no) and course subject as independent variables.
Bonferroni adjustments to correct for 11 comparisons (p < 0.004)
were used.
Results are presented in Table 3. As can be seen, students who
completed their courses were highly engaged with the videos. They
had more days of video activity, viewed a higher percentage of the
videos, and had a higher percentage of video minutes viewed. In addi-
tion, they were highly engaged with other activities in their course.
They entered their course homepage more, entered the learning units
more, entered unit pages more times on average, and entered the
additional materials more than students who did not complete their
courses. Furthermore, they read the forum posts more (thus, they
were more passively involved in forums). These differences were irre-
spective of course subject.
In regard to the rest of the activities, students who completed
their course had more total entries and submitted more assignments
than students who did not complete their course. However, these dif-
ferences were found to depend on course subject (the interactions are
presented in Figures 2 and 3, respectively). Specifically, Bonferroni
post hoc comparisons indicated that this was the case in all courses
(p < 0.001) except for course B (p = 0.11,p = 0.20, respectively).
Finally, regardless of whether or not students completed their
course, differences were found between course subjects in the per-
centage of videos that were viewed, the percentage of video minutes
that were viewed, students' passive involvement in forums, homepage
entries, and additional material entries. Specifically, Bonferroni post
hoc comparisons indicated that students in course A viewed a lower
percentage of videos than students in courses B and C (p = 0.001,
p = 0.003, respectively;M = 30.57,SD = 32.92,M = 46.06,SD = 33.79,
M = 46.41, SD = 41.66, respectively). Similarly, students in course A
also viewed a lower percentage of video minutes than students in
courses B and C (p = 0.004, p = 0.01, respectively; M = 51.44,
SD = 67.60,M = 84.99,SD = 96.14,M = 85.89,SD = 107.29, respec-
tively). In addition, students in course C were more passively involved
in forums than students in courses A, B, and D (ps < 0.001;M = 22.60,
SD = 21.95, M = 10.72, SD = 12.79, M = 9.23, SD = 9.37, M = 7.45,
SD = 10.93, respectively). Students in course B entered the homepage
more times than students in course A ( p = 0.001; M = 101.52,
SD = 7.54, M = 65.75, SD = 6.03, respectively). Finally, students in
course D entered the additional materials more times than students
in courses B and C (ps < 0.001; M = 9.18, SD = 0.65, M
= 1.39,
SD = 1.11,M = 3.73,SD = 0.92, respectively), and students in course
A entered the additional materials more times (M = 6.75, SD = 0.88)
than students in course B (p = 0.001).

5.2 | Predicting completion versus noncompletion of
the course, based on students' online activity
Logistic regression analysis was conducted in order to predict comple-
tion of the course based on online activity. Results indicated that both"
2019 - Students_ engagement characteristics predict success and completion of online courses.pdf,"the first block, which included course subjects (dummy coded), and the
second block, which included the activity variables, were significant,
χ2(3) = 18.15, p < 0.001; χ2(11) = 191.28, p < 0.001, respectively.
The final model that included both blocks was also significant,
χ
2(14) = 209.43, p < 0.001, Nagelkerke R2 = 0.415 as presented in
Table 4. As can be seen, course subject predicted completion, such
that the chance to complete course A was higher than the chance to
complete course B by 4.34, higher than the chance to complete course
C by 4.31, and higher than the chance to complete course D by 3.01.
Beyond course subject, the only other significant predictor of comple-
tion was percentage of assignments submitted, such that with each
increase of 1 submitted assignment, the chance to complete the
course increased by 1.03.
5.3 | Predicting students' exam grades, based on
their online activity in the course
Simple bivariate correlations were examined between students' exam
grades and their online activity in their course. It was found that
students' exam grades were mostly low but positively related to most
of the online activity variables: to percentage of assignments
submitted (r= 0.32, p< 0.001); video activity in days (r= 0.28,
p< 0.001); video views in percentage (r= 0.21, p< 0.001); passive
involvement in forums (r= 0.19, p< 0.001); course homepage visits
(r= 0.25, p< 0.001); learning unit entries (r= 0.21, p< 0.001); aver-
age unit page entries (r= 0.22, p< 0.001); and total entries (r= 0.30,
p< 0.001).Consequently, hierarchical linear regression analysis was
conducted in order to predict exam grades based on online activity.
The results indicated that the first block, which included the course
subject (dummy coded), explained 20% of the variance in exam
grades, F (3, 551) = 47.20, p < 0.001. The second block, which
included the activity predictors, added 13% to the explained vari-
ance, F
change(11, 540) = 9.36,p < 0.001. The final model was signif-
icant and explained 33% of the variance, F (14, 540) = 19.16,
p < 0.001. Table 5 presents the regression coefficients of the final
model. As can be seen, the significant predictors of exam grades
beyond course subject were reading the forum posts, course
homepage entries, unit page entries, total entries, and percentage of
assignments submitted. Specifically, the more students were passively
involved in the course (read more forum posts), entered the course
homepage more times, entered a unit page more times, and submit-
ted more assignments, the higher their grade was on the exam.
However, they had less total entries.

model. As can be seen, the significant predictors of exam grades
beyond course subject were reading the forum posts, course
homepage entries, unit page entries, total entries, and percentage of
assignments submitted. Specifically, the more students were passively
involved in the course (read more forum posts), entered the course
homepage more times, entered a unit page more times, and submit-
ted more assignments, the higher their grade was on the exam.
However, they had less total entries.

2019 - Students_ engagement characteristics predict success and completion of online courses.pdf,"6 | DISCUSSION
Students' engagement with the online courses and identification of
their engagement characteristics are attracting increasing attention
in the online learning environment (Sun & Rueda, 2012). Numerous
studies have reported a significant relationship between active
participation in online courses and academic performance
(You, 2016). This active participation can be traced because students'
learning behaviours are automatically recorded in the log files of the
LMS, which has become common in most educational institutions.
Thus, LMSs provide new opportunities for exploring students'
learning participation progress and performance (Campbell, 2007).
The present study aimed to examine the learners' engagement
characteristics in the online courses using learning analytics and their
impact on academic outcomes, trying to distinguish between course
completers and noncompleters. Moreover, the present study sought
to differentiate between those who pass the final exam and those
who do not.
6.1 | Differences in students' engagement for
completers and noncompleters
The findings indicated that there were significant differences
between students who complete and do not complete their online
course in most variables in the three distinct engagement strands:
course learning materials, interpersonal interaction among instructors
and students (reading the posts in the forums), and performance in
tasks and assignments. In all of the strands, the completer's activities
were more than twice as high, except for writing posts in the forums,
which was very low and not found to be significant. These results
are in line with previous studies that support the assumption
that engagement with various course activities and time spent in
study affects learning outcome and other outcome related behaviours

Students' engagement with the online courses and identification of
their engagement characteristics are attracting increasing attention
in the online learning environment. Numerous
studies have reported a significant relationship between active
participation in online courses and academic performance. This active participation can be traced because students'
learning behaviours are automatically recorded in the log files of the
LMS, which has become common in most educational institutions.
Thus, LMSs provide new opportunities for exploring students'
learning participation progress and performance.
The present study aimed to examine the learners' engagement
characteristics in the online courses using learning analytics and their
impact on academic outcomes, trying to distinguish between course
completers and noncompleters. Moreover, the present study sought
to differentiate between those who pass the final exam and those
who do not.
6.1 | Differences in students' engagement for
completers and noncompleters
The findings indicated that there were significant differences
between students who complete and do not complete their online
course in most variables in the three distinct engagement strands:
course learning materials, interpersonal interaction among instructors
and students (reading the posts in the forums), and performance in
tasks and assignments. In all of the strands, the completer's activities
were more than twice as high, except for writing posts in the forums,
which was very low and not found to be significant. These results
are in line with previous studies that support the assumption
that engagement with various course activities and time spent in
study affects learning outcome and other outcome related behaviours"
2019 - Students_ engagement characteristics predict success and completion of online courses.pdf,"(Wu, 2016). Specifically, the findings of this research supply a compre-
hensive understanding of the type of engagement reflected in each
student's online activity. With regard to course materials, in this
research as well as in previous research (Goda et al., 2015), students
who completed their course were highly engaged with the videos
(Ozan & Ozarslan, 2016), learning unit resources, and additional
materials and consistently submitted assignments (Lim, 2016). This
corresponds to other study findings that demonstrated that students'
late submission of assignments and frequency of course logins
predicted their course achievement (You, 2016), although students'
completion of learning assignments has a positive influence on their
interaction in regard to learning (Ma et al., 2015).
Furthermore, significant differences were found between course
subjects relative to students' engagement, regardless of whether or
not they completed their course. Differences were found only in
engagement with videos, additional materials, and reading posts
in the forums. Possible reasons could stem form the difference in
the characteristics of the content in each course, the relevance
of the course materials, and the characteristics of each lecturer
(Yukselturk & Bulut, 2007).
6.2 | Prediction of course completion and success on
the final exam
With regard to learning engagement in the online course, which
predicts completion of the course, the findings indicated that only
the course subject and submission of the ongoing assignments were
significant predictors of course completion. Furthermore, because
the grade was composed of weighting the assignment scores with
the final exam, it was important to explore the predictors that
impacted the final exam. It was found that engagement with the
course materials (average unit page entries, course homepage
entries, and total entries), as well as engagement in the forums by
reading the forum posts were significant predictors, as well as
course discipline and assignment submissions, which were also found
to be predictors of course completion. Therefore, the prediction of
success in final grades emphasized the significant importance of
engagement in various activities in the online course. Consequently,
in online courses, we should focus on students' engagement with the
course components and not on completion or noncompletion of
the course. Notably, it was interesting to find that in the studied
courses, interpersonal communication as well as engagement with
video lectures (video views, video activity in days, and minutes of
video viewed) were not found to be significant predictors of course
completion and success on the final exam. These results are in con-
trast to previous studies, which centralized the importance of these
activities as core elements in online courses (Agudo ‐Peregrina
et al., 2014; Ozan & Ozarslan, 2016). Possible reasons could be that
these activities were not obligatory and were not graded and
that students used other communication channels (e.g., email and
WhatsApp), which are external to the course website as well as
video lecture summaries that are produced and distributed by
the students.
7 | CONCLUSION
To conclude, this study provides essential information regarding
engagement characteristics as demonstrated by the students' online
activities. It also explores the differences between students who com-
plete their course and those who do not, in all three dimensions of
learning engagement as well as prediction variables for students' suc-
cess on the final exam and completion of the online course. Although
differences were found in all engagement characteristics (except for
writing posts in forums), only the course subject and the submission
of the assignments were found to be significant predictors of comple-
tion. With regard to the submission of assignments, it is not surprising
because they are part of the final grade, as for course subject, it could
be related to the differences in course characteristics, especially the
clarity and relevance of course content. However, when the predictors
of success on the final exam were analysed, the findings yielded other
results and in addition to course subject and submission of assign-
ments, engagement in regard to the interpersonal dimension (reading
the forum posts) and with course materials were found to be predic-
tors, as well, for success in an online course.
Understanding the differences between learners' engagement
characteristics, as well as the variables, which predict success on the
final exam, and completion of the course can assist in improving teach-
ing and learning in online courses and reduce dropout. For example,
empowering aspects of communication in the course for collaborative
learning and learning acquisition (Cohen & Soffer, 2015; Kožuh et al.,
2015), producing dedicated and helpful materials, and integrating
suitable assignments along the course accompanied with instructor
feedback. As mentioned in previous studies, the ability to understand
the students' online learning activities and evaluate the quality of
online teaching and learning is of great importance and assistance to
the instructors in designing the online courses, as well as supporting
their students (Robinson & Hullinger, 2008).
8 | LIMITATION AND FURTHER RESEARCH
Several possible limitations should be noted in the present study. First,
despite the differences that were found between completers and
noncompleters in learning engagement, conclusions regarding causal-
ity should be derived carefully and based on further research. The dif-
ferences that were found can be explained by other things such as the
differences between students in various characteristics. For example,
students who completed their course may have had greater motiva-
tion and better technological orientation, which could have assisted
them in their success and completion of their online course. In addi-
tion, differences in the instructors' characteristics may have biased
results (e.g., personality, technological skills, and teaching strategy).
These potential confounders require further investigation. Second,
future research should examine a larger sample of courses from
diverse disciplines and a heterogeneous student population. Third,
the interpersonal communication (active writing in forums) in the
online courses in the present study was relatively low and thus may
have attenuated significant effect on learning completion and success.
