ABSTRACT
Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields play grow-
ing roles in national and international economies by driving inno-
vation and generating high salary jobs. Yet, the US is lagging behind
other highly industrialized nations in terms of STEM education and
training. Furthermore, many economic forecasts predict a rising
shortage of domestic STEM-trained professions in the US for years
to come. One potential solution to this deficit is to decrease the rates
at which students leave STEM-related fields in higher education,
as currently over half of all students intending to graduate with
a STEM degree eventually attrite. However, little quantitative re-
search at scale has looked at causes of STEM attrition, let alone the
use of machine learning to examine how well this phenomenon can
be predicted. In this paper, we detail our efforts to model and predict
dropout from STEM fields using one of the largest known datasets
used for research on students at a traditional campus setting. Our
results suggest that attrition from STEM fields can be accurately
predicted with data that is routinely collected at universities using
only information on students’ first academic year. We also propose
a method to model student STEM intentions for each academic
term to better understand the timing of STEM attrition events. We
believe these results show great promise in using machine learn-
ing to improve STEM retention in traditional and non-traditional
campus settings.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
The United States’ (US’) standing in the twenty-first-century global
economy will largely depend on its ability to foster a workforce well-
equipped with skills in fields of science, technology, engineering,
and math (STEM) [2, 23]. This is because the growing pervasive-
ness and ubiquity of technology in modern society has increased
STEM fields’ central roles in driving economic growth and produc-
ing jobs through innovation and development [30]. That said, by
many measures, the US is lagging behind other world leaders in
training students in STEM fields [6, 15, 31] and must increase the
number of students graduating with STEM degrees by about 33%
just to fill future needs in the domestic workforce [25]. Considering
the importance of STEM-driven industries to national and regional
economies, these impending shortages of STEM-trained profes-
sionals have brought calls for systemic countermeasures in the US
[2, 13, 21, 23, 25]. One potential solution to these shortages is de-
creasing the attrition/dropout of students from STEM fields. In fact,
it is believed that 50-60% of students entering US colleges intending
to major in a STEM field ultimately either graduate with a non-
STEM degree or do not graduate at all [8, 9, 12, 25]. In many cases,
these students leaving STEM fields are capable students who could
have made valuable additions to the STEM workforce [ 7, 8, 19].
A 2012 report to the White House stated that decreasing the na-
tional yearly STEM attrition rate by just 10 percentage points from
2012 onwards will help reduce the impending shortage of STEM
professionals in 2022 by 75% [12, 25].
Thus far, little has been done to analyze and understand STEM
attrition from a data-/machine learning-centric perspective. In this
work, we model STEM attrition using data gathered from the regis-
trar databases of a large, publicly-funded US university. The broader
objective of this work is to better understand key determinants of
student attrition from STEM fields while also developing methods
to identify which students are at risk of transitioning away from
STEM fields during the course of their undergraduate academics.
Ultimately, we believe this work can influence policy decisions
and provide recommendations for interventions to improve STEM-
related student outcomes. In this paper, we present results from
our attempts to use student-level transcript data to: 1) model and
predict eventual STEM graduation using only students’ first-year
academic records and 2) identify and predict the time at which
students transition away from STEM fields during their undergrad-
uate academic careers. In this sense, we are not only interested in
predicting whether students will attrite from STEM tracks but also
when this occurs. We believe this to be the first look at STEM attri-

furthermore, the size of the dataset used in this study (over 24,000
students) is believed to be among the largest used for an attrition
study in a traditional university campus setting, STEM-specific or
otherwise.
1.2 Related Work
This work primarily relates to two bodies of literature: studies on
STEM attrition and studies on predictive modelling using student
data. The former has mostly centered on surveys or regression
analysis of longitudinal data. For example, Chen and Soldner used
longitudinal data to examine student attrition from STEM fields be-
tween 2004-09, finding STEM retention to be correlated with a wide
range of factors, including demographic and academic variables [9].
In later work, Chen examined the causes for STEM attrition among
high-performing college students using the same data source, not-
ing that the intensity of students’ early STEM coursework has a
large influence on their decision to leave STEM tracks of study [8].
Meanwhile, Rask used transcript records of 5,000 students at a small
liberal arts college to find that grades in early science courses as
well as pre-college preparedness (as measured by standardized test
scores) greatly influence STEM retention [28]. Bettinger looked at
students who entered Ohio colleges in the late 1990s to find that
earnings potential often drives high-performing students’ decisions
to move away from STEM fields [7]. Beyond this, there is still a need
for further exploration of the extent and causes of undergraduate
STEM attrition, as evidenced by recent conferences with education
leaders1.
The literature on predictive modelling using student data, mean-
while, is relatively recent and based on principles in educational
data mining (EDM) - a field centering on gaining insights from what
are typically large sets of educational data [29]. Much research on
attrition and dropout using EDM has centered on massive online
open courses (MOOCs) and other online environments [14, 20, 32].
However, studying attrition in MOOCs and other online settings
lends itself to much more expansive data collection opportunities
and a more detailed monitoring of students, as emphasized by Niemi
[24], thereby limiting the extent to which this work can be general-
ized to more traditional campus settings. Meanwhile, EDM-centric
work on attrition in more traditional campus settings has been
rather scarce and usually limited to small, homogeneous subsets of
students. As examples, Moseley predicted the attrition/graduation
of 528 nursing students using rule induction methods without con-
trolling for the amount of information available for each student (i.e.
the number of terms/semesters examined) [22]. Dekker et al. looked
at only the first semester grades of 648 students in the Electrical
Engineering department at the Eindhoven University of Technol-
ogy and predicted dropout with relatively strong (>75%) accuracy
[10]. Kovačić used tree-based methods on a similarly-sized dataset
of 453 students at the Open Polytechnic of New Zealand, finding
ethnicity and students’ course taking patterns to be highly useful in
prediction [17]. Studies with similarly-sized cohorts also focused on
informatics or engineering students at Masaryk University [5], the
University of Notre Dame [1], and an undisclosed public university
in the US Midwest [18]. These and similar studies, however, tend
to focus on relatively small groups of students (typically <2,000)
1http://usnewsstemsolutions.com/
with similar academic interests. What’s more, no previous study
has focused specifically on predicting student attrition from across
the spectrum of STEM fields.
The work we present more closely relates to a subset of literature
looking at student attrition in the context of the heterogeneity of
students across an entire campus and not just a subset thereof.
Delen used 8 years of institutional data on over 6,000 students (after
accounting for imbalanced classes) at a large, public US university
to predict whether the students would return for their second year
[11]. Ram et al. used data on about 6,500 freshmen at a large, public
US university to predict whether students would drop out after
their first semester, and for those that remained, whether they will
drop out after their second semester [27]. Our group has also shown
some early success in predicting dropout in more heterogeneous
data while using a much larger dataset (>32,000 students) [3].
In contrast to the above, this work seeks to predict attrition
specifically from STEM fields while using a dataset composed of an
extremely heterogeneous population across all undergraduates at a
large, public US university who intend on pursuing a STEM degree.
We also propose a proof-of-concept approach to trace student trajec-
tories into and away from STEM fields during their undergraduate
academics, which we hope can help provide further clarity on the
STEM attrition phenomena and inspire real-time intervention. In
all, we believe this work holds great promise to be expanded for
use in policy decisions and university student advising.
2 METHODS
2.1 Data
weDe-identified, psuedonymized data were gathered from the Uni-
versity of Washington’s (UW) registrar databases in early 2017. The
process of obtaining approval for, gathering, and curating this data
took over 2 years to complete. The data contain the demographic
information (race, ethnicity, gender, birth date, and resident sta-
tus), pre-college entry information (standardized test scores, high
school grades, parents’ educational attainment, and application zip
code, where available), and complete transcript records (courses
taken, when they were taken, grades received, and majors declared)
for all students in the University of Washington (UW) system. We
did not have access to financial aid information. For this work,
we focused on matriculated undergraduate students at UW’s main
campus in Seattle, WA who first enrolled between 1998 and 2010
as freshmen entrants (i.e. those who did not transfer from another
post-secondary institution, excluding running start and college in
high school students). The year 2010 was used as a cutoff for the
data to allow students first enrolling in 2010 to have 6 full years to
graduate from the time of first enrollment. In all, this was 66,060
students.
To focus on the issue of STEM attrition, we looked at students’
majors during their first calendar year on campus. Specifically, a
majority of freshmen students enter the UW system without a major
designation and are not required to formally declare a major until
the end of their 2nd year. As such, most students enter UW with
a “pre-major” designation of some sort. To predict STEM attrition,
only students who had either declared a major in their first year that","furthermore, the size of the dataset used in this study (over 24,000
students) is believed to be among the largest used for an attrition
study in a traditional university campus setting, STEM-specific or
otherwise.

was classified as a STEM major by UW2 or who had a pre-major
designation that corresponded to a STEM line of study (e.g. pre-
engineering, pre-health sciences, pre-physical sciences, etc.) were
included. Some UW majors have multiple degree tracks and for two
of these majors (math and design), some tracks were considered
STEM while some were not. The math degree had four tracks, one
of which was a non-STEM teaching preparation track; similarly,
the design degree also had four tracks, of which one (interaction
design) was considered STEM while the others were not. The data
in the registrar’s student major and degree database, however, did
not always distinguish which degree track within a major a student
pursued. As such, any degree that had at least half of its tracks
considered STEM was considered a STEM degree as a whole - in
the above cases, math was considered a STEM degree and design
was not.
The dataset of students intending to major in STEM fields in-
cluded 24,341 students and are henceforth referred to as “STEM
students” in reference to their desire to obtain STEM degrees. The
demographics of the student sample along with graduation rates in
STEM (i.e. STEM persistence rates) are shown in Table 1.
2.2 Defining STEM graduates
“Graduates” (grads) were defined as students who completed at least
one undergraduate degree within 6 calendar years of first enroll-
ment at UW; “non-completions” (NCs) were defined as all students
who did not graduate. UW uses a quarter-based academic calendar
and a 6-year time-to-completion was treated as 24 calendar quar-
ters after the quarter of first enrollment. Enrollment was defined as

cation of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes.
when a student received at least one transcript grade (regardless of
whether it is numeric or passing) as a matriculated student for a
term. The overall graduation rate in the dataset was about 78.5%
based on these definitions of graduate and non-completion.
STEM graduates were STEM students who met the above criteria
for being a graduate and graduated with a degree in a major that
was classified as STEM by UW. Meanwhile, any student who was
designated a STEM student as outlined in Section 2.1 but did not
ultimately graduate with a STEM degree was labelled as a STEM
NC. It should be noted that STEM NCs include STEM students who
graduated with non-STEM degrees but not with STEM degrees. In
the dataset, 12,121 of 24,341 STEM students graduated with a STEM
degree (49.80%) while 50.20% of students either did not graduate or
graduated with a non-STEM degree. This indication of whether or
not a STEM student was a STEM graduate was used as the binary
outcome variable for predicting STEM attrition. The nearly even
split of students into the two classes (STEM graduates and STEM
NCs) obviated the need for any balancing of the classes.
2.3 Predicting STEM attrition
2.3.1 Feature engineering. In predicting students’ graduation
with a STEM degree, only student data with information prior to
students’ attending UW and transcript records up through one
calendar year from their first enrollment (i.e. four consecutive aca-
demic quarters from their first enrollment) at UW was used for mod-
elling. First-year transcript data for the STEM students consisted
of 270,833 individual records of courses taken. The information
on students prior to their entry into UW included demographic
information and pre-entry information as described in Section 2.1.
In addition, US census data was used to add additional information
based on students’ application ZIP code including: average income
in ZIP, percentage of high school graduates in ZIP, and percent-
age of college graduates in ZIP. In addition, we also calculated the
distance from the ZIP code to UW using Python’s geopy package3.
Most demographic variables were categorical variables where
each student only belonged to a single category with mutually
exclusive inclusion in categories across variables. Each possible
race, ethnicity, gender, and resident status were mapped across
dummy variables. SAT and ACT scores, meanwhile, were available
for 94% and 27% of the data, respectively. To impute missing SAT
and ACT scores, we used a linear regression model with other
demographic and pre-college entry data. In our previous work, we
had tried using mean imputation for these missing values and did
not see an appreciable difference in performance [3]. Students’ pre-
entry and demographic information accounted for 52 total features.
The transcript data consisted of individual entries for each course
taken by each student, which included the students’ grade, declared
major at the time the course was taken, and when the course was
taken. For each student grade, in addition to the institutionally-
used GPA, a percentile score and z-score were also calculated. In
the below descriptions of features, we use student “performance”
to refer to five measures: counts of the number of courses taken,
the number of credits earned, average GPA, average z-score, and
average percentile grade. We calculated measures of student perfor-
mance across the first year. In addition, we also calculated measures

major at the time the course was taken, and when the course was
taken. For each student grade, in addition to the institutionally-
used GPA, a percentile score and z-score were also calculated. In
the below descriptions of features, we use student “performance”
to refer to five measures: counts of the number of courses taken,
the number of credits earned, average GPA, average z-score, and
average percentile grade. We calculated measures of student perfor-
mance across the first year. In addition, we also calculated measures"
Stemming the tide Predicting STEM attrition using student transcript data.pdf,"KDD’17, August 2017, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada L. Aulck et al.
of students’ performance in their respective first, second, third, and
fourth quarters individually as well as student performance in the
last academic quarter for which they were enrolled in their first year.
Differences between students’ performance in successive quarters
were also calculated as were counts of the number of failed courses
and withdrawals. In addition, measures of student course sizes and
grade distributions in courses were also calculated. These first-year
summary measures accounted for 116 features. Additionally, each
possible major declared by students was given a separate feature
(150 total).
In addition to summary data across the first year, we also cal-
culated student performance in specific course groupings. This
included performance in 100-, 200-, 300-, and 400-level courses as
well as performance in remedial (sub-100-level) courses. In addition,
student performance in STEM “gatekeeper” courses was also calcu-
lated, which included UW’s intro-level, year-long calculus, biology,
chemistry (inorganic and organic grouped together), and physics
series. This accounted for 60 additional features. Finally, we also
calculated student performance in courses for each departmental
prefix for which at least 6 students in the dataset had taken a course.
This accounted for another 1000 features across 200 course prefixes.
In total, there were 1,378 features for each student.
2.3.2 Machine learning experiments. We report results from four
ML models to predict the binary STEM dropout variable outlined
in Section 2.2 using the features described in Section 2.3.1. The
four models used were: regularized logistic regression, random
forests, adaptive boosted logistic regression (ada-boosted log reg),
and gradient boosted decision trees (gradient-boosted trees). In
these supervised ML experiments, we use a 80% random sample of
STEM students (training set) to tune model hyperparameters (e.g.
the regularization strength for logistic regression and the depth of
the trees in random forests) using 10-fold cross-validation. Measures
of performance are reported on the remaining 20% of data (4,862
observations; test set), which is not used in cross-validation and
hyperparameter tuning.
To better understand individual factors related to STEM gradua-
tion, we also run 1,378 individual logistic regressions of graduation
using each feature in the dataset in isolation. These models are
trained on the same training observations (i.e. students) and per-
formance is reported on the same test observations as above.
2.4 Analyzing STEM affinities
The methods detailed in previous sections use supervised ML ap-
proaches to predict whether students shift from STEM-based ed-
ucational pursuits. As stated earlier, while understanding factors
related to whether students graduate with STEM degrees is of great
interest, we are also interested in when students transition away
from STEM fields. To better understand the timing of these transi-
tions away from STEM, we present a proof-of-concept probabilistic
graphical model (PGM) of student affinities towards STEM majors
across time that is based on a modified Hidden Markov Model [16].
2.4.1 Model overview. The PGM (shown in Figure 1) represents
a student’s term-by-term (quarter-by-quarter, in this case) STEM
affinity as a series of T dependent hidden states where T is the
number of terms that a student is at the university. We define
“STEM affinity” as the calculated probability at any given term (t)
of a student eventually graduating with a STEM degree. Each of
the hidden states in the model (Xt ) produces a plate of N observed
states, with each observed state (Cti ) being a binary indication of
whether or not a student took a specific course for all N possible
courses (5,557 distinct courses in all). To simplify, allN observed
states are assumed to be conditionally independent given the hidden
state that produces them.
We use this particular model because it allows us to examine
when a student’s STEM affinity changes as they progress through
their undergraduate academic career. The model’s unsupervised
nature allows us to describe certain latent properties of student tran-
script records (such as intent), which are not quantifiable for study
using supervised ML approaches. This is advantageous because the
calculated STEM affinities can serve as proxies for students’ inten-
tions with regards to pursuing STEM or non-STEM academic paths
at each quarter. Thinking about these affinities as they relate to in-
tentions captures this idea because a student’s intentions influence
which courses they take at each quarter just as the hidden states in
the model produce the observed states. Though students’ declared
majors provide some indication of intent, students often begin pur-
suing alternate fields of study before formally declaring/changing
majors. What’s more, as discussed previously, most students enter
the university with non-specific pre-major designations.

2.4.2 Data for graphical model. To simplify, the data for this
proof-of-concept model consists of a subset of the data described in
Section 2.1 — it consists of all graduates (as defined in Section 2.2)
who entered UW in the 2004 calendar year. Limiting the data to a
single cohort helps ensure that students have access to the same
courses and majors, which are prone to change over time; limiting
data to graduates provides a notion of ground truth with regards
to whether or not a student eventually completed a STEM degree.
This limited dataset consists of 3,960 graduates who completed any
baccalaureate degree and their course history (137,348 transcript
entries). The feature engineering process outlined in Section 2.3.1
used for the supervised ML experiments was not used here. Fea-
tures for the model consist only of a list of student courses taken.
To further simplify, we only use binary indicators of whether or not
students took a course (not their grades therein) and each student’s","of students’ performance in their respective first, second, third, and
fourth quarters individually as well as student performance in the
last academic quarter for which they were enrolled in their first year.
Differences between students’ performance in successive quarters
were also calculated as were counts of the number of failed courses
and withdrawals. In addition, measures of student course sizes and
grade distributions in courses were also calculated. These first-year
summary measures accounted for 116 features. Additionally, each
possible major declared by students was given a separate feature
(150 total).
In addition to summary data across the first year, we also cal-
culated student performance in specific course groupings. This
included performance in 100-, 200-, 300-, and 400-level courses as
well as performance in remedial (sub-100-level) courses. In addition,
student performance in STEM “gatekeeper” courses was also calcu-
lated, which included UW’s intro-level, year-long calculus, biology,

series. This accounted for 60 additional features. Finally, we also
calculated student performance in courses for each departmental
prefix for which at least 6 students in the dataset had taken a course.
This accounted for another 1000 features across 200 course prefixes.
In total, there were 1,378 features for each student.
2.3.2 Machine learning experiments. We report results from four
ML models to predict the binary STEM dropout variable outlined
in Section 2.2 using the features described in Section 2.3.1. The
four models used were: regularized logistic regression, random

and gradient boosted decision trees (gradient-boosted trees). In

the regularization strength for logistic regression and the depth of
the trees in random forests) using 10-fold cross-validation. Measures
of performance are reported on the remaining 20% of data (4,862
observations; test set), which is not used in cross-validation and
hyperparameter tuning.
To better understand individual factors related to STEM gradua-
tion, we also run 1,378 individual logistic regressions of graduation
using each feature in the dataset in isolation. These models are
trained on the same training observations (i.e. students) and per-
formance is reported on the same test observations as above.

tions away from STEM, we present a proof-of-concept probabilistic
graphical model (PGM) of student affinities towards STEM majors
across time that is based on a modified Hidden Markov Model.
2.4.1 Model overview. The PGM (shown in Figure 1) represents
a student’s term-by-term (quarter-by-quarter, in this case) STEM
affinity as a series of T dependent hidden states where T is the
number of terms that a student is at the university. We define
“STEM affinity” as the calculated probability at any given term (t)
of a student eventually graduating with a STEM degree. Each of
the hidden states in the model (Xt ) produces a plate of N observed

entire transcript record is used to determine courses taken. As such,
the dataset consists of 3,960 graduates and binary indicators of the
courses they took for each academic term they were at UW; this
dataset is henceforth referred to as the “affinity dataset. ” About one
quarter of the students in the affinity dataset were STEM graduates
(23.5%) while the remainder graduated with non-STEM degrees
(76.5%). The largest numbers of students graduated in 12 and 13
quarters (16% and 13% of students in the affinity dataset, respec-
tively), which is consistent with taking about 3 academic quarters
per year for 4 years.
2.4.3 Model construction. We use the forward-backward algo-
rithm [26] to calculate term-by-term hidden state probabilities
(STEM affinities) for each student based on their corresponding
observed states (courses taken). To determine convergence, we set
a threshold of 0.5 for the maximum log likelihood for the hidden
state probabilities. A value of 0.5 for STEM affinity is used to define
the threshold for switching between a STEM intention classifica-
tion (STEM affinity ≥ 0.5) and a non-STEM intention classification
(STEM affinity < 0.5). The prior probability for the hidden states (X0)
is initialized as the proportion of students graduating with STEM
degrees in the affinity dataset (0.235). The initial transition prob-
ability matrix is determined by a cost function which maximizes
the number of students whose final-term STEM affinity matches
the STEM categorization of their degree while also minimizing the
number of students who switch between STEM and non-STEM tra-
jectories after their first quarter. The emission probabilities for each
of the N observed states (courses) are initialized as the proportion
of STEM and non-STEM graduates in the affinity dataset who took
each course. Laplace smoothing is applied to prevent zero values
when calculating the emission probabilities.
3 RESULTS & DISCUSSION
3.1 Predicting STEM attrition
3.1.1 Machine learning experiments. Receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curves for each of the four models are shown in
Figure 2. Prediction accuracies, the area under the curve of the ROC
curves (AUROC), and F1 scores are shown in Table 2. In all, model
performance was similar across all models (AUROCs between 0.87
and 0.89, F1 scores between 0.80 and 0.82), with logistic regres-
sion performing slightly better than the other models. Interestingly,
boosting seemed to have no appreciable increase in predictive per-
formance, as can be seen with the small performance difference
between Ada-boosted logistic regression and logistic regression.
Seeing logistic regression perform better than other models is in line
with what our group has seen in the past when predicting dropout
across all students [3]. As was the case with our previous work, we
believe these results are strong given the limited amount of infor-
mation fed into the models, as data was extracted from registrar
records alone. That said, we also view these results as baselines to
be improved upon in future work, particularly with respect to more
extensive feature engineering and alternative modelling techniques,
as discussed in Section 4.
3.1.2 Individual predictors of STEM success. To better under-
stand individual factors related to STEM attrition, we also regressed
the binary STEM graduation variable on a single feature at a time.

Figure 2: Receiver operating characteristic curves for super-
vised ML models predicting STEM graduation.
When examining the 10 best individual predictors of STEM success
as shown in Table 3, the importance of success in math classes
to STEM students’ educational pursuits becomes apparent. Five
of the 10 most predictive features in isolation, including the four
most predictive, were derived from student performance in math
courses: 1) average GPA in math gatekeeper courses, 2) average
percentile score in math gatekeeper courses, 3) average GPA in
math courses, 4) average percentile score in math courses, and 9)
average z-score in math classes. While it should be noted that these
features are highly correlated, the fact that no other subject’s grades
were among the 10 most predictive features in isolation speaks to
the weight of math courses in changing STEM-related student out-
comes, particularly during students’ first academic year. Though
not specific to math, this idea of performance in introductory STEM
classes relating to STEM success ties in with findings in previous
work [8].
In addition to math courses, students’ average z-score in all
courses and their average z-score in 100-level courses were also
among the most highly predictive single features (5th and 6th, re-
spectively). Interestingly, z-score calculations had higher predictive
power than measures of GPA and percentile rank for these per-
formance measures. General measures of student progress such as","entire transcript record is used to determine courses taken. As such,

number of courses passed by students were also highly predictive
(7th and 8th, respectively). The 10th most predictive feature was the
average of the difference between students’ grades in courses and
the highest grade awarded in those same courses. Measures of per-
formance in high school and standardized test scores, meanwhile,
did not seem to have a large signal in predicting STEM attrition,
in contrast to previous research [ 28]. This could, however, be at
least in part due to the breadth of high schools attended by students
entering a large, public university and the lack of normalization of
the grades therefrom. It could also be due to the highly competitive
nature of many STEM majors.
3.2 Understanding STEM transitions
Better understanding STEM attrition also begs the question of
where STEM students transition to upon leaving STEM fields. Of
all STEM NCs in the dataset (12,220) about 60% (7,303) ended up
graduating with non-STEM degrees. Table 4 presents the count
and percentage of the non-STEM fields that these STEM NCs most
frequently graduated from. It should be noted that due to changing
major size/availability as well as the introduction of new majors
across time, these counts were not normalized in any way. That said,
the raw counts indicate that graduating STEM NCs most frequently
graduated with degrees in psychology (13.45% of graduating STEM
NCs), which saw over 1.5 times as many students graduate than
the field with the second-most graduates, economics (8.39% of grad-
uating STEM NCs). Further examining the list, the more popular
majors tended to be in the social sciences with some from business
(namely, accounting and finance) seen at the tail end of the top ten.

where STEM students transition to upon leaving STEM fields. Of
all STEM NCs in the dataset (12,220) about 60% (7,303) ended up
graduating with non-STEM degrees. Table 4 presents the count
and percentage of the non-STEM fields that these STEM NCs most
frequently graduated from. It should be noted that due to changing
major size/availability as well as the introduction of new majors
across time, these counts were not normalized in any way. That said,
the raw counts indicate that graduating STEM NCs most frequently
graduated with degrees in psychology (13.45% of graduating STEM
NCs), which saw over 1.5 times as many students graduate than

uating STEM NCs). Further examining the list, the more popular

Table 4: Most frequently obtained degrees by STEM NCs"

To further examine these STEM transitions, Figure 3 shows a
heatmap of graduating STEM NCs and their transitions from STEM-
related fields to non-STEM fields. Our group has constructed similar
heatmaps in the past to analyze student transitions across fields
and believe them to be a way to better understand the multitude of
paths students take towards degrees [4]. The rows indicate students’
STEM majors/pre-majors declared during their first academic year,
as described in Section 2.1 when detailing the isolation of STEM stu-
dents. The columns of the heatmap indicate the fields from which
students graduated. Only the 20 most frequently obtained degrees
are shown in the columns and the row counts only include stu-
dents who graduated with these degrees. A few interesting patterns
emerge when looking at these student transitions. Students with
pre-engineering designations tended to favor going into economics
rather than psychology, which was more popular with most other
groups of graduating STEM NCs. Pre-engineering students also
had a higher tendency to graduate from business-related fields (in-
cluding accounting, finance, and information systems) than their
graduating STEM NC peers. Students who declared STEM-related
pre-majors that were not related to engineering, health sciences, or
the physical sciences had more variability in their academic paths as
they favored going into sociology, anthropology, and public health
more than their peers. This group of students consisted of those
who had declared a pre-major in a STEM field that had its own
pre-major track and designation, a trend that has been growing at
UW as additional competitive major groups are added. This group
also had the smallest sample (n = 28) of the STEM student groups.
In all, a majority of graduating STEM NCs earned degrees that were
concentrated in the social sciences with little variation other than
that noted above. It should be noted that this heatmap does not take
into account transitions across or towards STEM majors as other
studies have [7, 8], but only transitions away from STEM fields.
3.3 Analyzing STEM affinities
To validate the performance of our graphical model, we compared
whether students’ calculated designation of STEM or non-STEM
for their final quarter (based on a STEM affinity threshold of 0.5)
with whether or not they were a STEM graduate. Here, the STEM
affinity (intention) for the last quarter can be checked because we
know what the students ultimately graduated with; for all previous
quarters, however, it cannot as there is no measure of students’
STEM intention. Based on this, the accuracy, recall, and precision
of the model were 0.896, 0.999, and 0.670, respectively.
Figure 4 shows the estimated proportion of STEM-labelled stu-
dents across time for students that graduate in exactly 12 quarters.
This subset of the data (i.e. the 643 students graduating in exactly
12 quarters) was chosen because, as mentioned in Section 2.4.2, the
largest proportion of students in the affinity dataset graduated in 12
quarters. Additionally, 12 quarters also represents the typical 4-year
undergraduate time-to-completion. As shown, the proportion of
these students with STEM trajectories begins relatively high in the
first three quarters and sharply drops thereafter before stabilizing
around the 7th quarter, which typically corresponds to the start of
students’ 3rd academic year. The sharp decline, meanwhile, occurs
during most students’ 2nd year, just prior to when most students
are required to formalize their major decisions. It is during this

jor in STEM across time for all students graduating in ex-
actly 12 quarters. Note the large decrease in prospective
STEM students during their 2nd year on campus.
pivotal time that one would expect STEM attrition to occur. The
initial spike in STEM-interested students, we believe, can at least
in part be attributed to noise in the model, which is discussed in
greater detail below.

or out of (right) STEM trajectories by quarter at the univer-
sity. Calculations are based on STEM affinities for each stu-
dent at the end of each quarter. Only the first 11 quarters are
shown as a majority of students graduate within 12 quarters.","To further examine these STEM transitions, Figure 3 shows a
heatmap of graduating STEM NCs and their transitions from STEM-
related fields to non-STEM fields. Our group has constructed similar
heatmaps in the past to analyze student transitions across fields
and believe them to be a way to better understand the multitude of
paths students take towards degrees. The rows indicate students’
STEM majors/pre-majors declared during their first academic year,
as described in Section 2.1 when detailing the isolation of STEM stu-
dents. The columns of the heatmap indicate the fields from which
students graduated. Only the 20 most frequently obtained degrees
are shown in the columns and the row counts only include stu-
dents who graduated with these degrees. A few interesting patterns
emerge when looking at these student transitions. Students with
pre-engineering designations tended to favor going into economics
rather than psychology, which was more popular with most other
groups of graduating STEM NCs. Pre-engineering students also
had a higher tendency to graduate from business-related fields (in-
cluding accounting, finance, and information systems) than their
graduating STEM NC peers. Students who declared STEM-related
pre-majors that were not related to engineering, health sciences, or
the physical sciences had more variability in their academic paths as
they favored going into sociology, anthropology, and public health
more than their peers. This group of students consisted of those
who had declared a pre-major in a STEM field that had its own
pre-major track and designation, a trend that has been growing at
UW as additional competitive major groups are added. This group
also had the smallest sample (n = 28) of the STEM student groups.
In all, a majority of graduating STEM NCs earned degrees that were
concentrated in the social sciences with little variation other than
that noted above. It should be noted that this heatmap does not take
into account transitions across or towards STEM majors as other
studies have, but only transitions away from STEM fields.
3.3 Analyzing STEM affinities
To validate the performance of our graphical model, we compared
whether students’ calculated designation of STEM or non-STEM
for their final quarter (based on a STEM affinity threshold of 0.5)
with whether or not they were a STEM graduate. Here, the STEM
affinity (intention) for the last quarter can be checked because we
know what the students ultimately graduated with; for all previous
quarters, however, it cannot as there is no measure of students’
STEM intention. Based on this, the accuracy, recall, and precision
of the model were 0.896, 0.999, and 0.670, respectively.
Figure 4 shows the estimated proportion of STEM-labelled stu-
dents across time for students that graduate in exactly 12 quarters.
This subset of the data (i.e. the 643 students graduating in exactly
12 quarters) was chosen because, as mentioned in Section 2.4.2, the
largest proportion of students in the affinity dataset graduated in 12
quarters. Additionally, 12 quarters also represents the typical 4-year
undergraduate time-to-completion. As shown, the proportion of
these students with STEM trajectories begins relatively high in the
first three quarters and sharply drops thereafter before stabilizing
around the 7th quarter, which typically corresponds to the start of
students’ 3rd academic year. The sharp decline, meanwhile, occurs
during most students’ 2nd year, just prior to when most students
are required to formalize their major decisions. It is during this
pivotal time that one would expect STEM attrition to occur. The
initial spike in STEM-interested students, we believe, can at least
in part be attributed to noise in the model, which is discussed in
greater detail below.
Figure 5: Calculated counts of students switching into (left)
or out of (right) STEM trajectories by quarter at the univer-
sity. Calculations are based on STEM affinities for each stu-
dent at the end of each quarter. Only the first 11 quarters are
shown as a majority of students graduate within 12 quarters."

Figure 6: STEM affinity across time for a single student in the dataset as a case study. The affinities are presented for each quar-
ter and the corresponding courses that the student took in each quarter are shown. The green line indicates the 0.5 threshold
for switching from a STEM to non-STEM trajectory. Note how the first two quarters see the student taking introductory STEM
courses while the latter quarters are more focused on the humanities and social sciences.
A switch in a student’s STEM intention classification occurs
when the student’s intention classification from a given quarter
differs from their label in their previous quarter. Analytically, this is
determined by finding two adjacent quarters where STEM affinity
scores cross the 0.5 threshold that determines intention classifica-
tion. Figure 5 shows the number of switches per quarter across
the entirety of the affinity dataset on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
As expected, students switch STEM intentions frequently during
the beginning of their academic careers. This aligns with the intu-
ition that student intentions are more volatile at the start of their
schooling due to a number of factors. First, general education re-
quirements introduce noise into the model as students take a wide
range of courses simply to fulfill requirements early on. Second,
students often undergo an exploratory phase in their education to
better scope their interests upon entering college. Third, student
intentions correct to their “true” values following their initial as-
signment based on our estimated prior. Figure 5 also shows a spike
in STEM attrition occurring after the 4th quarter, which aligns with
what is seen in Figure 4. In all, most quarters after students’ 1st
see a much higher rate of students switching away from STEM
intentions than students orienting towards STEM pursuits.
In Figure 6, we show a single student’s STEM affinity scores
over time along with the courses they took as a case study. This
specific student provides an example of a student shifting from a
STEM trajectory to a non-STEM trajectory. Examining the graph,
the student’s affinity scores in the first 2 quarters strongly suggest
a heavy inclination towards a STEM major. The corresponding
courses the student took during these two quarters provides context
to this - about half the students’ courses (3 of 7) are in pre-STEM
topics as the student takes introductory math and chemistry courses.
Meanwhile, the other courses the student took during this period
were very generalized electives which did not heavily weigh in the
calculations of their STEM affinity. At the end of the student’s third
quarter, however, their STEM affinity decreased substantially and
their fourth quarter courses pushed their STEM affinity beyond
the transition point (marked by the green line in the Figure). The
courses taken in these two quarters are strongly associated with
non-STEM fields, as the student began focusing on comparative
history, foreign languages, and the social sciences at large while not
taking any STEM-related courses. Their courses thereafter align
with their low STEM affinity score as the student continues to
take courses in the humanities and social sciences. The student
remains on this non-STEM trajectory after their early transition and
eventually graduates with a non-STEM degree. Observations such
as these are interpreted as the student’s intended major switching
from a STEM track to a non-STEM track. This student’s STEM
affinity plot also provides examples of the transition points we are
interested in further identifying and understanding, particularly
around the third quarter.
In all, we believe our initial attempts at modelling STEM affinities
and, by proxy, student STEM intentions provides a promising first
step in identifying when students change their academic interests.
That said, we also believe there are numerous ways to expand this
approach to better model student trajectories, as discussed further
in Section 4.","Figure 6: STEM affinity across time for a single student in the dataset as a case study. The affinities are presented for each quar-

4 FUTURE DIRECTIONS
We believe this work provides many potential avenues for expan-
sion and further exploration. For the supervised predictions of
STEM attrition, more expansive feature engineering should im-
prove model performance. One idea we intend to explore relates
to the fact that most students who enter UW do so with pre-major
designations of some sort (about 81% of students, as calculated from
our dataset) and then declare a major in their 2nd or 3rd year on
campus. If a student is a pre-major, it is difficult to determine which
specific course of study they are interested in pursuing though there
may be some broad sense (i.e. pre-engineering, pre-health sciences,
etc.). However, requirements for entry and the level of competition
for limited spots4 vary greatly across majors and having a better
understanding of how a student is faring compared to peers in-
tending to enter the same field should give a strong indication of
how likely they are to succeed in following their current academic
trajectory. To better understand this, we intend to use students’
course history to estimate their major(s) of interest (perhaps using
expanded affinity scores similar to as we do in this work). From
there, we can compare each student to weighted composites of
students who entered the majors of interest for the student in order
to get a sense of how the student is faring as a pre-major. Addition-
ally, we are also interested in additional technical improvements
to our models, including the use of neural networks to improve
predictions and believe predictive power can be improved using
alternative modelling techniques.
To expand the work on analyzing STEM affinities, we plan to
further develop our model to better understand when students
transition away from STEM fields. Currently, there is no way to
validate the STEM affinity scores against a student’s actual STEM
intentions at each time period. While we tuned the model according
to the cost function described in Section 2.4.3, it only examines
STEM affinities at the beginning and end of their transcript. We
hope to explore options to include more comprehensive heuristics
that will reflect the long-term behavior of our model. In addition,
the current state space of the model captures relatively high-level
STEM and non-STEM probabilities that could lead to potential loss
of information during transitions. As mentioned above, we are
interested in expanding the state space from STEM and non-STEM
labels to each to individual major. Additionally, we only use a small
subset of the data available to us in modelling the students in this
work. We believe adjusting our model assumptions/parameters
such that data from multiple cohorts can be used should provide a
more comprehensive look at STEM affinities. Experimenting with
different objective functions for optimizing the model may also be
further explored, particularly with improving model precision.
Another potential idea to better identify the transition points
that the graphical model attempts to elucidate is to add properties
such as “affinity inertia, ” which would aggregate affinity scores
from multiple previous quarters, thereby reducing the impact of a
single transcript entry in our model. We believe this affinity inertia
could reduce the noise generated in our model from general edu-
cation requirements as shown in some of the results shown here.
Upon better identifying transition points, we could use supervised
machine learning methods to understand what additional features
4See: http://bit.ly/2kVjV1z
from student transcripts predict changes in student STEM affin-
ity and, by proxy, student STEM intentions. These features could
include grades, demographics, and course evaluation information.
Additionally, we are also actively working with UW to better col-
lect and curate student intention information for entering students,
which we believe will provide another information-rich data source
for our models.
Ultimately, we believe the entirety of this work has many ap-
plications in advising at university campuses. Identifying students
who are likely to change their academic interests provides a wealth
of opportunity to develop interventions for identifying struggling
students and preventing them from dropping out. Furthermore, the
proof-of-concept graphical model we present provides an idea of
not only who will attrite from STEM fields but also when they may
be inclined to do so. This understanding of when can be crucial to
providing students assistance in a timely manner.
5 CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we present results for predicting and understanding
STEM attrition from a large, heterogeneous dataset of students
using only data mined from university registrar databases. The
predictions yielded promising results with about a 30 percentage
point increase in accuracy over the baseline proportions. Analyzing
individual predictors of STEM attrition, meanwhile, gave support
to the idea that math classes and entry STEM classes play crucial
roles in students’ pursuit of STEM degrees.
We also found that students shifting out of STEM follow varying
paths to completion, particularly pre-engineering students. Com-
pared to their peers, we found pre-engineering student to have a
greater propensity to graduate in economics and business-related
fields. Meanwhile, across all students who switched away from
STEM pursuits, psychology was by far the most popular degree
earned, not adjusting for the size of the major.
Our probabilistic graphical model provided a proof-of-concept
approach to modelling term-by-term student intentions as they
progress in their undergraduate academics. Using the affinity scores
we calculated, we were able to outline points at which students
tend to transition away from STEM fields. Namely, a large amount
of switching occurs early in students’ academic careers or near
the time when they are required to declare a major (typically their
2nd year, in our dataset). After this, student STEM intentions were
relatively stable.
Our next steps for this work include improving our supervised
machine learning models, expanding the scope of our probabilistic
graphical models, and working with university administrators to
develop interventions. For more information on our research, visit
