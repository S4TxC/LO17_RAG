Abstract
The academic performance of a student in a university is determined by a number of
factors, both academic and non-academic. Student that previously excelled at the
secondary school level may lose focus due to peer pressure and social lifestyle while
those who previously struggled due to family distractions may be able to focus away
from home, and as a result excel at the university. University admission in Nigeria is
typically based on cognitive entry characteristics of a student which is mostly academ-
ic, and may not necessarily translate to excellence once in the university. In this study,
the relationship between the cognitive admission entry requirements and the academic
performance of students in their first year, using their CGPA and class of degree was
examined using six data mining algorithms in KNIME and Orange platforms.
Maximum accuracies of 50.23% and 51.9% respectively were observed, and the results
were verified using regression models, with R
2 values of 0.207 and 0.232 recorded
which indicate that students ’ performance in their first year is not fully explained by
cognitive entry requirements.

1 Introduction
Nigeria, with a teeming population of over 180 million people has a very large pool of
people who earnestly desire university education. The last decade has witnessed a steep
rise in the demand for university education in Nigeria."
2018 - Data mining approach to predicting the performance of first year student in a university using the a.pdf,"high that only a meagre 15.3% of applicants at the most get the chance to be admitted
into a Nigerian university each year (Aluede et al. 2012). Nigeria currently has one
hundred and fifty two (152) universities that furnish the higher education demands of a
fresh 1.7 million aspiring undergraduates each year. This is besides the five hundred
thousand (at the least) young Nigerians that graduate from these higher institutions of
learning every year (Saint et al. 2003). Nigerian universities have people from various
culture coming together to learn. The northern region of Nigeria, which before now,
were laid back about university education, is now witnessing a surge in demand for
university education (Popoola et al. 2018).
With increasing growth in the national population and demand for post-graduate
education, it became evident that the number of tertiary institutions in the country is
grossly inadequate. The Federal Government of Nigeria has explored e-learning and
distance learning to cater for the teeming number of Nigerians who desire university
education. The National Open Univers ity of Nigeria (NOUN) was established
chiefly for the purpose of providing e-learning and distance education services
to Nigerians, and other interested parties abroad (Ajadi et al. 2008). NOUN serves
as an Open and Distance Learning (ODL) p latform that provides instructional
materials to students, to enable self-paced learning which is very convenient for
working student based on the framework by Indira Ghandi National Open
University (IGNOU), India. The program needs continuous performance monitor-
ing and improvement to ensure compliance with global best practices on ODL
delivery. Implementation of online-base d, peer-assisted stud y sessions (Nikolic
and Nicholls 2018) might help in providing supplementary instruction and peer-
based support for NOUN students towards enhancing student performance.
According to (Olsson and Mozelius 2016), when direct learning facilitation is not
feasible, there is a need to ensure that alternative self-learning platforms are adequate,
in order to prevent failure rates from increasing. The study by (Burke and Fedorek
2017;K u r t 2017) assert that self-directed learning, based on flipped classroom model
enhances student learning while (Van WYK 2018) recommends the use of flipped
classroom concept in open distance e-Learning programmes for enhancing students ’
experience, understanding and performance. In contrast, (Burke and Fedorek 2017;
Ebbeler 2013) posit that flipped classroom may not necessarily improve student
learning experience because students who are used to traditional classes often prefer
the traditional approach while those in flipped classes may not be ready for the
transition. Also, it may be challenging to teach a flipped class and likewise, flipped
classes may also not be easy for students.
The deregulation of university education in Nigeria brought a new push for the
creation of more universities in Nigeria (Adeogun et al. 2009). But this push came with
its attendant problems of clearer disparity between the Bhaves^ and Bhave nots ^,a n d
declining educational quality due to profit maximization (Babalola 1998). The Federal
Government of Nigeria, through the instrument of the National Universities
Commission (NUC), keeps working assiduously to alleviate the myriad of problems
bedevilling university education in Nigeria. The body provides the regulatory needs for
university education in Nigeria and ensures along with other stakeholders, the imple-
mentation of all quality assurance policies in Nigerian universities (Ajayi and
Ekundayo 2008). The National Universities Commission along with other bodies like

criteria are usually used, the most prominent of them being the need to have credits in at

Recently, a lot of universities started internal university undergraduate selection
programmes based on their customized criteria. A famous example is the Covenant
University Scholastic Aptitude Screening (CUSAS) programme (Popoola et al. 2018).
The CUSAS of Covenant University for example, has a very stringent list of require-
ments for her aspiring undergraduates. These requirements cut across academic, emo-
tional, financial, social, moral and spiritual areas (Popoola et al. 2018). The aim of
selection programmes and policies for student admission is to ensure that all-round
students, in terms of capacity, capability, creativity and motivation are given the few,
prestigious, keenly and fairly contested admission slots available.
In this study, the relationship between cognitive entry characteristics of students at
the point of admission as measured by the students ’ entry age, the aggregate WAEC
score, the JAMB score, the university based CUSAS score and the students ’ first year
academic performance measured by their grade class and the actual CGPA is consid-
ered using data mining. This study seeks to determine the extent of the relationship
between the admission criteria used by Nigerian universities for selecting qualified
prospective undergraduate applicants for 100 L admission, and the academic perfor-
mance of the student after the first academic session using data mining algorithms and
regression-based models.
2 Educational data mining
Data mining is a knowledge discovery process which entails the extraction of intelli-
gent information from a given dataset using scientific methodologies (Azevedo 2018;
Hussain et al. 2018). Dataset accumulated overtime from a process or system contains
hidden historical information which can be data mined for enhancing the quality of
decision-making processes. Data mining entails the use of algorithms for identifying
patterns and trends within a dataset. Educational data mining is the extraction of useful
information from dataset generated in the educational domain (Tair and El-Halees
2012; Ryan and Baker 2010; Senthil and Lin 2018; Bharara et al. 2018). Educational
databases are rich sources of information for evaluating student performance and for
various predictive analyses (Ahmed and Elaraby 2014;K h e d ra n dE lS e d d a w y2015;
Bharara et al. 2018). It also helps in identifying any hidden relationship between
students’ performance and their learning characteristics (Hussain et al. 2019; Ahuja
et al. 2019) and behaviours (Kim et al. 2018). Useful information obtained from data
mining can be used to improve the quality and the mode of delivery of higher education
systems (Daradoumis et al. 2019) in order to improve teaching efficiency, and ulti-
mately student performance (Baepler and Murdoch 2010;O s m a n b e g o v ić and Suljic
2012; Agarwal et al. 2012). Data mined information can guide in identifying areas of
intervention such as course redesign, modification of communication strategies, im-
proved assessment methods, and so forth towards improving the quality of education
and aptitude (Baepler and Murdoch 2010).

2018 - Data mining approach to predicting the performance of first year student in a university using the a.pdf,"Educational data mining is a data driven process for identifying student learning
issues and performance trends in institutions of learning (Bucos and Dr ăgulescu 2018).
Machine learning has found application in studying the academic behaviour and
performance prediction of students (Kostopoulos et al. 2018). The various areas of
application of machine learning in education includes prediction of drop out and
graduation potential (Ahuja and Kankane 2018; Nurhayati et al. 2018), prediction of
academic performance (Roy and Garg 2018; Fernandes et al. 2019), assessment of the
learning process (Khan and Ghosh 2018) and identification of learning risks, evaluation
of administrators, evaluation of students ’ textual feedback (Ibrahim et al. 2019;A t t a
UR et al. 2018), assessment of the interactions among the educational stakeholders, as a
pilot for guiding the implementation and integration of institution-based educational
technologies (Angeli et al. 2017), and so forth (Rodrigues et al. 2018). Data-driven
learning is the order of the day, and more research works are being dedicated toward
improving knowledge in this field. In educational data mining, the accuracy of the
algorithm and the model implemented depend on the nature, and the size of the data
under study (Almarabeh 2017). Educational data mining and data mining generally, are
strongly data-driven, and as such, issues of privacy and consent may arise with respect
to the potential commercial value of data (Lynch 2017). Hence, adequate modalities for
managing such must be ensured.

The study by (Baepler and Murdoch 2010) identified a distinction between
academic analytics and data mining. Academic analytics is a hypothesis driven
process which involves the use of dataset for solving an academic problem while
data mining is a speculative process for id entifying wealth of useful information
from seemingly insensible information without any predetermined hypothesis.
According to (Bharara et al. 2018), learning analytics entails the application of
analytic tools for studying students, t he collection and analysis of student ’s virtual
learning platform interaction-related data, while educational data mining is a
computer-based learning approach for detecting unique patterns in student related
dataset for identifying new findings and for testing theories.
A predictive analysis was performed by (Ahmed and Elaraby 2014) using 1548
student sample records from 2005 to 2010. In the study, features such as lab test grade,
midterm grade, scored level of student participation etc. were applied using a decision
tree to identify students that are likely to fail. K-means clustering algorithm was applied
by (Bhise et al. 2013) to predict student result using student database records, while in
the study by (Yadav et al. 2012), the potential of a student to drop out was predicted
using decision tree classifiers. Using selected features from students ’ database, the
performance of students was classified by (Kaur and Kaur 2018) using six different
data mining algorithms; Naïve Bayes, K-NN, 1-NN and Decision Tree (C5.0, C4.5,
CART). By applying knowledge discovery techniques using data mining, the study by
(Burgos et al. 2018) evaluated student records from e-learning platforms for students
taking distance learning courses using predictive models. After model implementation,
a teaching plan was developed and deployed, and the teaching plan was able to reduce
student dropout rate by 14% as compared with previous academic sessions.

The features considered include the course information, student attendance, average
scores, level of student activity and the number of credits passed in the preceding
session. The use of correlation and multiple linear regression analysis for predicting the
graduation CGPA of students using their GPA for a period of five years was demon-
strated by (Pelumi Oguntunde et al. 2018). In (Sivakumar and Selvaraj 2018), the
performance of student was predicted using multiple supervised classifiers for perfor-

4 Methodology
In this study, an analysis was carried out to show the extent of the relationship between
the academic record of students of Covenant University in Nigeria at the point of
admission, based on the university admission entry requirements, and the academic
performance of the admitted students in the first year as measured by their 100 L CGPA
and the class of grade using predictive data mining and regression models. Methods
such as regression analysis and artificial neural networks have been deployed in this
area (Arsad and Buniyamin 2014) but in this study, a data mining model was deployed
on KNIME and Orange platform, and the veracity of the prediction was checked using
regression analysis for performance comparison. Based on the dataset by (Odukoya
et al. 2018), 1445 student records from 2005 to 2009 were analysed. The following
features in the dataset were examined: the student ’s entry age, the aggregate WAEC
score, the JAMB score, the university based CUSAS score, the first-year grade
classification while the actual CGPA was considered for the regression analysis.
These features represent the key requirements by the Nigerian University
Commission (NUC) for admission into engineering programmes in Nigeria. The
student grades fall into the following categories, first class (1st), second class lower
(2|1), second class upper (2|2) and third class (3rd) respectively. The KNIME and
Orange Analytic applications were run on Core ™i3-7100 U CPU 2.4GHz, 6 GB Ram

9 Summary of results
In the KNIME model, the maximum accuracy is 50.23% and the lowest accuracy is
39.631% whereas for the Orange model the accuracy varied from 51.9% to 42.8%. The
performance of both models is quite close, which implies that the data mining algo-
rithms on both platforms were able to identify the extent of the hidden relationship
between the cognitive admission entry requirements and the class of grade of the
students in their first year. With a maximum 51.9% accuracy for both data mining
models; it implies that the students ’ entry age, the aggregate WAEC score, the JAMB
score and the university based CUSAS score which are the key admission entry criteria
into 100 L programmes, only partially explain the performance (class of grade) of the
admitted student in their first year at the university. This means that other non-academic
factors and attributes of each admitted student which may not be easy to measure at the
point of admission, coupled with the personal lifestyle and struggles while in the
university are potential determinants of the academic performance of students in their
first year. The linear regression model had a F-statistic of 94.2 which is significant at a p
value of 3.01E-71 but with a R
2 value (coefficient of determination) of 0.207; it implies
that the admission entry criteria only explains 20.7% of the 100 L CGPA variation. A
similar result was observed for the quadratic regression model with a R 2 value of 0.232
which indicates a weak predictive relationship.
The results of the KNIME and Orange data mining models, and the regression
analysis carried out in this study show that there is a relationship between the admission
entry requirements, and the academic performance of the admitted student in their first
year but this relationship is not very strong as revealed by the accuracies of the
predictive algorithms. Selection criteria for admission into the university in Nigeria
are mostly based on the academic profile of applicants. The result of this study
therefore emphasizes the need to re-evaluate the admission criteria and the need to
consider other non-academic factors that may be indicators of student dedication,
motivation and passion for success. Excellence in sports, leadership experiences,
participation in student projects at secondary school level etc. are likely factors that
should also be considered in the admission process. Apart from the natural effects of an
individual’s academic prowess and learning skills on their academic excellence in a
university, other factors such as the level of attendance at lectures, number of sick days,
family issues at home that may affect a student ’s psychological state, financial chal-
lenges, average scores in the first set of tests, social lifestyle, availability of support
programmes within the university e.g. counselling and so forth also play key roles in
the overall performance of a student.

2018 - Data mining approach to predicting the performance of first year student in a university using the a.pdf,"research, the quality of facilities and the general institutional management (Idachaba
2018b), can greatly affect academic performance in universities. Other factors that
could affect academic performance in universities include administrative bottlenecks
and the flaunting of laid down policies and ground rules. Ensuring academic excellence
for students in their first year of study requires a holistic approach that encompasses the
selection of academically promising applicants, provision of adequate facilities, staff
and faculty; availability of purpose-fit student orientation, counselling and mentorship
programmes, availability of a proactive performance evaluation system, and so forth.
10 Conclusion and future scope
The use of various selection criteria by regulatory bodies in Nigeria and Nigerian
universities has led to the admission of a higher percentage of academically sound and
aspiring undergraduates, and a concentration of great talents in Nigerian universities. It
has also helped to sift out a higher percentage of unqualified candidates and reduce the
rate of underhand admission practices in Nigerian universities, although there are
existing opportunities for further improvement in admission procedures and practices.
Admission entry requirements are vital indices for selecting students for ad-
mission in higher institutions. The analysis in this study reveals the extent to
which the admission entry requirements can be used as performance predictors
once in the university system, using Covenant University in Nigeria as a case
study. Data trends presented in box plots show that the WAEC, CUSAS and
JAMB entry scores of students are higher for those who had 1st class grade,
followed by those on 2|1, and then 2|2 and finally students on 3rd class had the
least average scores. The educational data mining carried out using KNIME and
Orange platform had maximum accuracies of 50.23% and 51.9% respectively, and
this shows that the cognitive entry characteristics of a student as defined by the
admission entry requirements, does not fully explain the eventual first year class
of grade of that student. To validate the results of the data mining models, linear
and quadratic regression analytical models were developed and R-squared values
of 0.207 and 0.232 were observed respectively, indicating a weak relationship
between the first year CGPA and the admission entry requirements. This therefore
makes it vital to ensure that admission selection criteria are robust enough to allow
for a well-mixed breed of students with var ying unique strength, not necessarily
academic that may eventually translate to success once in the university.
At present, the analysis so far has focus ed generally on the relationship of the
admission entry criteria and the 100 L performance of the student. It will be
interesting to consider classifying the student records based on their demographic
attributes such as gender, family income level, religion, average family size, state of
origin etc. in a bit to identify new trends and hidden knowledge. The effect of

It will be interesting to consider classifying the student records based on their demographic attributes such as gender, family income level, religion, average family size, state of origin etc. in a bit to identify new trends and hidden knowledge.
