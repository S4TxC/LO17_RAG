Abstract—This paper studies the patterns of learning behaviour in connec-
tion with educational achievement in multi-year undergraduate data science mi-
nor specialisation for non -STEM students. In particular, t his work focuses on 
analysing the predictors of academic achievement in blended -learning setting 
factors related to initial mathematics knowledg e, specific traits of educational 
programs, online and offline learning engagement, and connections with peers. 
Robust linear regression and non-parametric statistical tests reveal a significant 
gap in the achievement of students from different educational programs and on 
the connection between their class attendance and achievement. The results in-
dicate that achievement is not related to the communication on the Q&A forum 
while peers do affect academic success.

1 Introduction and Background 
A ubiquitous proliferation of demand for data science -related competences (data 
literacy) poses new challenges for universities all over the world. On the one hand, 
high market demand makes it easy to attract students from different disciplines [1], 
including non-STEM disciplines [2]. On the other hand, it makes the student audience 
extremely heterogeneous in terms of disciplinary background and the level of mathe-
matical preparation [3], complicating the pedagogical design. 
This paper is a part of the project dedicated to studying the patterns of learning be-
haviour in connection with educational achievement in multi-year undergraduate data

unites students from different non -STEM programs and departments ranging from 
economics to oriental studies. Students study the basics  of computer science and dif-
ferent methods and techniques related to data science, text mining, and social network 
analysis. The first cohort of students started their studies in September 2015, and the 
second cohort started one year later in September 2016. 
Traditional face-to-face classroom settings for the data science minor are supported 
by a virtual learning environment (VLE), a web -based software system that includes 
an RStudio Server IDE and a Q&A forum. Students can access the same working 
environment inside and outside the class due to the web -based nature of VLE. Also, 
the nature of the subject and the setting inform the choice of a blended learning ap-
proach for the minor. 
One of the major issues on the course is the level of skill disparity among students. 
Some students, especially those having previous experience with programming and IT 
(e.g., they had statistics and IT-related courses), tend to grasp the new material quick-
er, while other students may struggle through the unfamiliar topics. Consequently, the 
course is supplemented with an online exercise part complementing regular class -
based lessons with seven modules, with each module addressing different aspects of 
data analysis. This strategy supports students who struggle to learn programming and 
follows recommendations to support advanced students [4] . Each module became 
available for students after the corresponding topic was covered in class by the in-
structor and were open until the end of the first semester with an unlimited number of 
attempts. The completion of more than 60% of the assignments in the additional 
modules accounted for 10% of the final grade. 
Having such a mixed group of studen ts with very diverse levels of math 
knowledge, different motivation and learning involvement levels, as well as a combi-
nation of offline and online learning components , requires the creation of  a baseline 
model connecting different aspects of student learn ing behaviou rs with academic 
achievement while considering student diversity and existing social ties. In addition, 
the model must answer the following research question: ""How are different aspects of 
students’ learning behaviour in a blended learning data science course connected with 
academic achievement, considering students’ background diversity and existing social 
ties?"" 
This paper discusses our first results of building such a model while combining es-
timates of peer effects generated by offline ties of nominated friendship and metrics, 
capturing various aspects of learning behavio ur, and partially controlling for the di-
versity of students’ backgrounds in math.

to the university's academic culture. Several studies have shown higher grades on 
math-related courses being a positive indicator of advanced potential even on non -
math-related courses [8], [9]. 
A student’s behaviour and academic achievement are influenced by the diversity of 
social groups he or she is a participant. Different types  of social networks (e.g., 
friendship and advice) have different effects on academic success  [10], and the top-
performing students can form a rich club where the communication is very active and 
fruitful, leading to higher final academic achievement of the members [11]. Mean-
while, low performing students are deprived of the access to these networks, having 
fewer chances to improve academic achievement. 
In addition, peer instruction is considered an important aspect of CS courses. Spe-
cifically, [12] states this practice has been  successful in the case of non -STEM stu-
dents in CS courses. Students who were affiliated with a group demonstrated higher 
final academic achievement than those who g ot through the course by themselves  
[12]. 
Furthermore, research shows that the  effect of the number of friends on academic 
achievement is nonlinear. At first, the relationship is positive, but after a certain 
threshold, the trend changes: having too many connections leads to lower achieve-
ment. The maintenance of the large and diverse connections needs resources, such as 
time and attention, that might be spent studying [10], [13]. 
The social environment also affects the achievement of students through social 
comparison mechanisms [14], [15]. Also, comparison with more successful peers 
increases individual's achievement, although the comparison decreases students self -
concept [16]. However if the gap between the student and the reference group be-
comes too large, it deprives the student and leads to lower achievement [14]. 
The third group of relevant studies comes from the rapidly evolving area of learn-
ing analytics and educational data mining  [17], [18]. Specifically, current develop-
ments in the field are connected with the appearance of large amounts of data about 
students’ learning behaviour in VLEs and learning managemen t systems (LMS). The 
analysis of this data may help in finding non -trivial patterns of students' learning 
behaviour as well as determinants of academic achievement [19]. 
The blended model of learning has certain features of both online and offline learn-
ing methods. One of the notable features is the automatic grading of a certain type of 
assignments, which is usually provided by VLEs. Moreover, VLEs allow multiple 
attempts for the students to successfully accomplish the assignment, leading to two 
substantial strategies students might employ to accomplish the assigned tasks  [20]. 
The first strategy assumes that students are cognitively involved in the task- solving 
process, and this strategy can be observed as the low ratio of wrong attempts. In con-
trast, students might use trial and error approach. The latter strategy might be an indi-
cator of lower course engagement and lead to worse academic achievement in the 
future, despite the student eventually completing the assignment [20], [21]. 
In addition, the assessment of students’ data in the form of  binary outcomes (ratio 
of successful vs. unsuccessful attempts) despite its simplistic nature might also be a 
good predictor. In particular, Petersen claims that the existing tools used to predict 
academic achievement based on programming errors and debugging skills demon-

strate major differences in predictive power based on course content and the pro-
gramming language used [22]. Nonetheless, the type of mistakes adds to the predict-
ing ability of the model. For example, unsuccessful students make syntactic errors 
(and too many attempts), preventing them from solving the problems [23]. 
In this regard, the non-obligatory assignments' completion rate seems to be a useful 
indicator of academic achievement. Meanwhile, [24] that the completion of the addi-
tional non- mandatory assignments has a positive effect on academic  achievement 
only after adjusting the results based on previous programming experience. 
Another predictor specific for the offline model of learning is class attendance. Re-
search on the effect of lecture attendance on academic achievement in CS courses 
demonstrated negative relationship [25]. This result is partially explained by the 
availability of course materials online, opportunities for independent study practise . 
Home assignment completeness is associated with increased final grade; however, the 
effect varies considerably based on the year observed [25]. 
Thus, three main dimensions of learning behaviour and the lives of student that are 
related to students’ achievement are explored in this paper: 
• Previous achievement that can be operationalized either as general abilities or as an 
average grade the student got in previous years. Higher abilities indicate higher 
chances to be successful in each subsequent course. This predictor is found to be 
more influential than parental status, a nd it is believed that achievement may re-
flect student's SES.  
• Social environment: A student's friends can both enhance the achievement (through 
networks of help and advice, as well as due to inclusion in the rich club) and de-
crease it (if the student has too many friends or the gap between her or his abilities 
and the achievements of others is too large).  
• Engagement in offline and online learning: As students are more involved in learn-
ing and some activities related to the study process, their achievement s are higher. 
The amount of overall training, additional tasks performed by the student, attend-
ance, and other proxies of how much the student is interested in the course should 
be considered. 
3 Data and Methodology 
Data (Table 1) was extracted from VLE and contains three main parts: 
Students' programming activity logs show how much the student coded overall, 
which is a proxy of general learning engagement. As a student is more interested in 
the minor, the more he or she trains the coding skills while trying to solve the tasks 
and goes beyond the standard tasks given to everybody. The overall number of code 
lines written by each student was log transformed because of its clearly exponential 
distribution and wide range from 500 to 20000 lines of code. These programming 
activity logs also provide data on non -obligatory student activity on academic 
achievement. Specifically, the data relates how many additional tasks students tried to 
perform and the percent of wrong submissions.

grade gap was created, reflecting the difference between the individual achievement 
of a student and the average achievement of his or her friends. 
Previous achievement was measured by a student’s previous year GPA.

the sum of the raw scores for the following tests: two midterms and the final exam.

4 Analysis and Results 
The aim of this work is to determine the main predictors of student academic 
achievement in the blended learning model. Specifically, this work focuses on the 
factors associated with the following three dimensions of a student's academic life:  
• Previous achievement, previous math knowledge (based on student’s educational 
major) 
• Different types of connections with peers 
• Off-line and online learning activities. Using robust OLS regression, significant 
factors are identified and their effects on a student's academic success are com-
pared, providing an overview of the factors relevant to the achievements of stu-
dents in the blended learning model in a data science minor program in a Russian 
university. 
The robust linear regression results are presented in Table 2 where the final model 
is a result of a backward selection procedure.  
The effect of engagement in learning (measured by code quantity metrics) is signif-
icant and positive. Specifically, a 1-point increase in the log of the lines of code writ-
ten (range of the variable: 4 -10) is associated with nearly a 3 -points increase in aca-
demic achievement. This variable also can serve as an indicator of the self -guided 
work.

Another interesting result is the insignificant effects of the communication activity 
on the Q&A forum in any form (QA and QA intensity). As shown in Table 1, forum 
communication is perceived as a proxy to cognitive engagement in the learning pro-
cess, as substantial discussions require a deep understanding of both theoretical con-
cepts behind data analysis and practical implementation rules. Additional data on 
reading the Q&A forum, unavailable for this study, could help to explain the relation-
ship between academic achievement and passive consumption of communication.  
According to the model, there is no linear connection with the student's previous 
achievement (GPA) while controlling for other predictors.  
The percentage of non -obligatory assignments completed (addit. tasks) and the 
percentage of wrong submission attempts (wrong attempts) on the online platform are 
complimentary. The first percentage indicates the overall extra learning activity pro-
gress, while the second predictor indicates the strategy used to accomplish assign-
ments. The student may use a number of wrong attempts hoping to get the right solu-
tion, or they may invest in deeper  understanding of the task and make one or just a 
few submissions. The strong negative effect on academic achievement corresponds to 
other studies of blended learning settings [20]. 
As in [24], our model shows a significant positive effect  of non-mandatory exer-
cises: the submission of all extra assignments is associated with a 12.66-point increase 
in academic achievement. 
Sociology students (program - soc) have no statistically significant direct increase 
in terms of academic achievement in comparison to students from other social science 
& humanities programs, although students from educational programs with larger 
mathematics components (program - ecmanlog) have approximately a 5-point in-
crease in mean academic achievement while controlling for other predictors. Another 
result is the difference in effects of attendance fo r the programs with a larger mathe-
matics component. Table 2 shows that the interaction of attendance with the educa-
tional program has a significantly lower effect (attendance: program interaction term) 
on academic achievement among students from economics, management, and logis-
tics departments in comparison with social and humanities programs (excluding soci-
ology). Existing research in the field considering CS1 courses shows a negative asso-
ciation between lecture attendance and academic achievement [25] . In our case , one 
possible explanation is that the academic performance of economics and management 
students, whose majors more efficiently prepare them to study data science, depends 
less on in-class participation in their learning. 
Furthermore, student gender (gender) does not demonstrate either a significant di-
rect connection nor an indirect (moderated) effect. 
To study the peer effect s, the difference in achievement between those stated they 
have no friends (no friends) and those who stated they have friends was analysed; two 
subsamples were then compared using the Kruskal -Wallis test. According to the re-
sults, the null hypo thesis was rejected (Kruskal -Wallis chi-squared = 10.401, df = 1, 
p-value < 0.01, Ml = 30, M2 = 37, n1 = 22, n2 = 170), and students with access to a 
friends network are characterized to have higher academic achievement than their 
peers without nominated friends, confirming the findings in [11].

on the Q&A forum in any form (QA and QA intensity). As shown in Table 1, forum 
communication is perceived as a proxy to cognitive engagement in the learning pro-
cess, as substantial discussions require a deep understanding of both theoretical con-
cepts behind data analysis and practical implementation rules. Additional data on 
reading the Q&A forum, unavailable for this study, could help to explain the relation-
ship between academic achievement and passive consumption of communication.

The grade gap with the friends (grade gap) demonstrates a significant positive con-
nection with academic achievement. Students who got higher grade than their friends 
did in the first semester tend to have an additional increase in academic achievement. 
5 Conclusion 
In this research, we analysed the main predictors of academic achievement for the 
2nd year non-STEM undergraduates from a blended data science course. The factors 
related to initial mathematics knowledge, specific traits of educational programs, 
online and off-line learning engagement, and connections with peers were considered. 
Social sciences and humanities educational programs' students have significant ly 
lower achievement than students from economics, management, and logistics pro-
grams, moreover the latter demonstrated weaker positive connection between class 
attendance and academic achievement. 
Also, communication on the educational Q&A forum, which is in the literature as-
sociated with higher cognitive involvement, showed no statistically significant con-
nection with academic achievement with control for other predictors, requiring  a 
deeper exploration of this and other achievement factors . Many of the active forum 
users also show a high level of engagement in coding and online exercises. Thus, a 
form of the Matthew effect can be proposed here: students engaged in the subject get 
even more actively engaged, while others do not benefit from additional forms of task 
discussion. 
In addition, connections with peers have a significant effect on a student’s 
achievement. A student being more successful than their friends lead to an additional 
increase in academic achievement. These effects seem to work for any st udents re-
gardless of the educational level and specialization. One of the possible explanations 
is that peer support, especially when peers have more expertise in the subject, boosts 
the self-confidence of a student. Self -concept is also enhanced by the positive com-
parison with others. Specifically, being better than the frame of reference makes a 
student more confident in any academic domain.  
This study represents our first attempt to build a baseline model of academic 
achievement in a blended setting of an introductory data science course and has some 
limitations. 
First, this work mostly focuses on metrics of learning behaviour and does not con-
sider the effects of demographic factors while they have shown to have minor effects 
(in comparison with GPA) in university settings [6]. 
Second, with regard to the insignificance of previous achievement effects, scenari-
os with relationships between previous academic success and observed academic 
achievement being non -linear or mediated by other variables should be further ex-
plored. While there is a significant medium correlation between previous academic 
success and academic achievement (r = 0.43, n = 189, p < 0.01 ), it also correlates 
significantly with engagement in learning, e.g. code lines (r = 0.52, n = 189, p < 0.01), 
and class attendance (r = 0.44, n = 189, p < 0.01).
