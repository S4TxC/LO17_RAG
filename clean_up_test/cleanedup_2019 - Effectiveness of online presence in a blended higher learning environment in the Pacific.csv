ABSTRACT
The widespread use of technology has facilitated many changes in the
education sector including higher education. Academic institutes are
concentrating their eﬀorts on measuring the level of student engagement
and participation in online learning environments for student success.
This paper analyses student log data to quantify the eﬀectiveness of
online presence on student performance in a blended course using
frequency and duration as indicators. The analysis shows both frequency
and duration having a statistically signiﬁcant impact on the students’ ﬁnal
marks. The study proposes a multiple linear regression model using these
measurements to predict theﬁnal mark of students in a blended learning
environment. The predictive regression model, explained through the use
of two new models; Online Measurable Presence Model (OMPM) and
Slingshot model, can be used to determine the eﬀectiveness of student
online presence for success in a blended higher learning environment in
the Paciﬁc.

Introduction
The acronym ICT refers to Information and Communication Technologies which can be described as
the human interaction through the use of computing or technological devices (Margaret2005), and
their enormous growth has deeply impacted the education landscape in the last three decades
(Latchem 2017). The integration of ICT into education has brought forward a variety of learning
environments ranging from a stand-alone computer in classrooms to a pre-packaged computer tech-
nology (Margaret2005; Youssef and Dahmani2008), establishing a need to redesign courses and re-
engineer their delivery modes.
The spread of digital media has introduced broad changes and new skills into teaching and learn-
ing processes while re-designing courses for diﬀerent modes of delivery. Siemens (2013) and Buck-
ingham (2007) state that digital media has allowed ubiquitous access to resources and virtually
inﬁnite amounts of information to people, as well as aﬀording new forms of sociality, play, creativity,
social activism, networking, and collaboration. With technology seen as the prime driver of pedago-
gical changes, many education providers have acknowledged the new digital media and introduced
new methods of learning in their curriculum (Latchem2017; Youssef and Dahmani2008). The new
digital environment has enabled changes in learning modes from teacher-centered traditional learn-
ing to self-paced and self-directed learning, and has invariably facilitated a signiﬁcant change to the
distance education (Huang, Yang, and Hu2012; Youssef and Dahmani2008; Conijn et al.2017; Bar-
agash and Al-Samarraie2018). Traditional distance learning has been transformed to a real-time web-

Introduction
The acronym ICT refers to Information and Communication Technologies which can be described as
the human interaction through the use of computing or technological devices , and
their enormous growth has deeply impacted the education landscape in the last three decades
. The integration of ICT into education has brought forward a variety of learning
environments ranging from a stand-alone computer in classrooms to a pre-packaged computer tech-
nology , establishing a need to redesign courses and re-
engineer their delivery modes.
The spread of digital media has introduced broad changes and new skills into teaching and learn-
ing processes while re-designing courses for diﬀerent modes of delivery. Siemens (2013) and Buck-
ingham (2007) state that digital media has allowed ubiquitous access to resources and virtually

from facilitators, feelings of isolation, lack of student motivation and insecurities about learning
which led to high dropouts (Sharma et al.2015; Youssef and Dahmani2008; Zacharis2015).
Higher Education Institutes (HEI) have adopted the web-facilitated distance learning models to meet
the growing demand for distance education, and reduce the barriers to distance andﬂexible learning.
This method of learning, denoted as eLearning, also actively promotes student-centered learning and
oﬀers new and moreﬂexible methods of teaching and learning (Sharma et al.2015; Youssef and
Dahmani 2008;Z a c h a r i s2015; Baragash and Al-Samarraie2018). A number of studies conducted
recently on eLearning indicate that online presence has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on students’ learning
and achievement (Dixson2010;M o o r e2014; Vaughan 2014; Zacharis2015; Yang et al.2016;C o n i j n
et al. 2017;M w a l u m b w ea n dM t e b e2017; Baragash and Al-Samarraie 2018). This opens up a
window of opportunities to determine the best indicators or measurements of online presence for
student success, and consequentially redesign courses for diﬀerent modes of delivery. The aspirations
of HEI in the Paciﬁc remain the same, if not deeper and more pronounced from the viewpoint of the
smallness and remoteness of the Paciﬁc Island countries (PICs) (Sharma et al.2015).
The Paciﬁc region comprises 22 island countries with a total population of 11 million people
spread across 33 million square kilometers of the Paciﬁc Ocean (Paciﬁc Community 2017; Reddy
et al. 2016). The PICs are classiﬁed as developing countries by the World Bank because they lack
proper (or complete) infrastructure and have lower living standards, human development indexes
and economies (World Bank2016). While each regional country has its own priorities, a shared com-
mitment of the Paciﬁc region is to create twenty-ﬁrst century learners for the globalized world, and
help mobilize societal transforms and cultural changes (Sharma et al.2015). This is also in line with the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Therefore, each country invests heavily in ensuring quality
education for all its people. The HEI in the Paciﬁc are also looking into ways how the ICT tools and
technologies can be utilized to deliver quality education equitably throughout the region, focusing
more recently on blended and online modes of delivery with associated institutional research toﬁnd
out what works best in these delivery modes (Bhartu and Yusuf2016; Nabobo-Baba, Lingam, and
Dakuidreketi 2014;
 Raturi 2014; Jokhan, Sharma, and Singh2018).
In this research paper, to better understand the role of various elements of online presence
in students’ performance in a blended course in higher education in the Paciﬁc, we formulated
the following questions:
(1) Is there a relationship between the total number of times a student has accessed the topic and
his/her ﬁnal marks?
(2) Is there a relationship between the total time spent by a student in a topic lesson and his/herﬁnal
marks?

Learning management system
A learning management system (LMS) is a software-based system used for the administration, docu-
mentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational courses and student interaction through
online means (Dougiamas and Taylor2003; Sclater 2008; Zacharis 2015; Conijn et al.2017; Mwa-
lumbwe and Mtebe 2017; Baragash and Al-Samarraie 2018). One very popular LMS in HEI is the
modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment (Moodle), which can be used in many
types of environments such as education, training and development and in business settings (Dou-
giamas and Taylor2003; Zacharis2015; Conijn et al.2017; Mwalumbwe and Mtebe2017). It is also a
platform for teaching and learning that can be used to supplement face-to-face (F2F) courses or
online courses or even facilitate a combination of both of these modes in form of a blended learning
environment (Zacharis 2015; Conijn et al.2017).

2019 - Effectiveness of online presence in a blended higher learning environment in the Pacific.pdf,"Blended learning and its requirements
Traditional blended learning, also known as hybrid learning, is the combination of online activities
and face-to-face instructions (Graham 2013). However, in recent years blended learning has
evolved to a rich blend of eﬀective and social opportunities of face-to-face classes with a technol-
ogy-enhanced online environment (Graham 2013; Graham, Woodﬁeld, and Buck Harrison 2013;
Watson 2008; Zacharis2015; Conijn et al.2017; Baragash and Al-Samarraie2018). Therefore, present-
ing an opportunity for the blended learning requirements to focus on the technology enhanced
elements such as the instructional strategies to a greater extent. Relevant models governing
diﬀerent forms of blended learning are discussed next.
Figure 1 illustrates the diﬀerent blended learning forms such asRotation, Flex, Self-blend and
Enriched Virtual that have been designed recently for primary and secondary school sectors (Staker
and Horn 2012, 2014; Staker 2011), from which two (Rotation and Enriched Virtual models) are rel-
evant to HEI while the other two are educationally feasible (Pandit2012; Friesen2012). In theRotation
model, students rotate between diﬀerent stations on a ﬁxed schedule, either working online or
spending F2F time with the teacher in a course (Staker and Horn2012; Horn and Staker 2011).
Some activities carried out through this model are small-group or full-class instruction, individual
tutoring, group projects and assignments.
The courses which support a large number of non-traditional or at-risk students often choose theFlex
model(Staker and Horn2012). Within this approach, content and instructions are primarily delivered online.
The teachers are present to provideF2F support as needed, while learning is primarily self-guided as the
students independently learn and practice new concepts in a digitally enriched environment.
The Self-blend model gives students the opportunity to take courses to another level (Staker and
Horn 2012). While the students will attend a traditional F2F environment, they also opt to supplement
their learning through online courses oﬀered remotely. In order for this pedagogical model to be suc-
cessful the students must be highly self-motivated. The self-blend model is ideal for students with
interests in a subject area that is not covered in the course curriculum.

of student learning when the students are located remotely. The model diﬀers from theﬂipped class-
room because the students seldom meet F2F with their teachers. It also diﬀers from fully online
courses and programs because the F2F learning sessions are mandatory (Horn and Staker2011;
Staker and Horn2014).
There are many advantages of blended learning; however, in the interest of brevity, we will only
discuss the 4 main ones which are categorized as ease of use, independence, advanced learning and
ﬂexibility (Welker and Berardino2005; Zacharis 2015). Students are likely to interact more with the
instructor and peers since there are numerous opportunities to do so in F2F class and the online environ-
ment. Students can participate more in class discussions since they can choose the environment (online
or face-to-face) in which they feel more comfortable. Students often develop or enhance skills in time
management, critical thinking, and problem-solving and have timely access to content (Welker and
Berardino2005;). Then, students can acquire useful skills from using the Internet and computer technol-
ogy as advanced learning. Finally, the students have more timeﬂexibility, freedom and convenience
working at preferred times online from their home that also decreases commuting and parking troubles.
On the other hand, there are disadvantages of a blended learning environment which are
explained below through diﬀerent categories (Cucciare, Weingardt, and Villafranca 2008; Welker
and Berardino2005):
. Confusion: Ineﬀective use of the technological tools in learning can be wasteful. If facilitators and
employees are unaware of how to use the learning technology on hand they probably will not get
the results they are looking for, and students can get confused due to unclear or confusing
instructions.
. Social Interaction:Students achieve reduced interaction with their peers and teachers if the learn-
ing environment is not well structured and its important features missing.
. Access: There can be delay in responses from teachers in the asynchronous environment for
question related matters where due to time-bound modules accessibility of the resources such
as reference materials are hindered.
. More Work: There is a lot more reading by students to attempt their activities such as supplemen-
tary reading to accomplish a dedicated task or activity.
. ICT Competencies: The facilitators and learners must have suﬃcient ICT knowledge and a willing-
ness to learn in blended environments. Some may not be familiar with technology and hence have
an additional learning curve ahead of them.
. High Technology Setup & Maintenance Costs: Purchasing the learning technology such as devices
and infrastructure setup for blended learning programs can be very costly.
To eliminate the aforementioned drawbacks a suitable model needs to be chosen and appropriate
training conducted to make blended learning work with students. One also needs to have support on
hand to teach new online learners and motivate those who may be reluctant to communicate and
engage online (Welker and Berardino2005; Zacharis2015; Baragash and Al-Samarraie2018). Figure 2
shows a roadmap for blended learning at The University of the South Paciﬁc that incorporates the uni-
versity’s requirements of blended learning into diﬀerent clusters for eﬀective equitable learning in the
Paciﬁc. The new roadmap builds on the framework constructed by Singh in2003 which had shown
diﬀerent ingredients for successful blended learning programs, and contextualizes it for the Paciﬁc.

Background
The University of the South Paciﬁc is a regional multi-campus, multi-modal higher education insti-
tution operating since 1968, with a student cohort of more than 29,000 populating its 14 campuses
and 11 centers (Chandra2017; The University of the South Paciﬁc 2015). The‘University’ is collectively
owned by its 12 member countries– Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue,
Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu spread over the Paciﬁc Ocean (see
Figure 3). The population of these countries range from a high 867,000 (Fiji Islands) to a low 1160
(Tokelau). The land area also varies signiﬁcantly, the smallest being Tokelau with a land area of
about 12 square kilometers (Paciﬁc Community2017).
Each ‘University’ member country houses at least one campus, which usually varies from others in
size and student population, support services and facilities, infrastructure, and, modality of courses
and programs. The smaller centers are a part of the larger campuses normally spread across
remote locations or based in the outer islands of some regional countries. The main campus,
Laucala Campus, is located in Suva (Fiji Islands) and has the highest headcount as the hub of the Uni-
versity’s administrative, academic and commercial operations (Sharma et al.2015; The University of
the South Paciﬁc 2015). The main campus also coordinates and facilitates most of the courses and
programs in online and blended modes oﬀered in the region through Moodle.

This exploratory research design utilizes mixed methods; a blend of diﬀerent qualitative and quanti-
tative research methods which explore the eﬀectiveness of online presence of students in a blended

Settings
The blended course chosen from The University of the South Paciﬁc for this Study is UU100– Com-
munication and Information Literacy. It is a 14-weekﬁrst year course oﬀered in blended and online
modes at all the campuses and centers of the university. The aim of this course is to ensure that all
incoming students develop knowledge and competence in the use of computers and information
resources. The course is designed to address the broader imperative for students to develop their
capacity to locate, access, evaluate and use information eﬃciently and e ﬀectively (Reddy and
Sharma 2015). UU100 comprises of a number of assessments including topic assessments, online
quizzes, assignments and e-portfolio activities, the majority of which have to be submitted online
through the Dropbox in Moodle. The topic assessments include topic lesson which comprises of
topic notes, videos and reinforcement questions; and topic activity which can be either a quiz,
Dropbox or a question/answer forum (Reddy and Sharma2015).
Diﬀerent measures of online presence
Researchers have chosen diﬀerent sets of variables to measure the online presence in blended
environments for their research based on factors such as LMS, online tools, course website design
and learning analytics.
For example, Mwalumbwe and Mtebe (2017) generated a prediction model for student perform-
ance based on LMS, which made us aware of diﬀerent variables utilized in the Learning Analytic Tool.
The model showed that exercises and forum posts were the only 2 variables to impact student

on their impact on student’s ﬁnal performance.
Motivated by the inﬂuential work of Mwalumbwe and Mtebe (2017) and keeping in mind beha-
viorism and learning styles of Paciﬁc students, this research considered a set of variables that were
only captured through Moodle. These are listed underTable 1with their sources from the literature.
The sources inTable 1validate the reliability of these variables as eﬀective indicators of online pres-
ence. Then from correlation analysis some of the variables were disregarded because of a high cor-
relation between these variables may have resulted in multicollinearity. Therefore, we selected
frequency and duration as our main variables. In addition, instead of looking at login and logout
data for the LMS, we have focused our research on login and logout data of individual topics and
activities incorporated in a selected blended learning environment. The reason for exploring the
frequency and duration of lessons and activities is to obtain a comprehensive insight into students’
performances based on their real interaction.
Data collection and analysis
The qualitative data were collected through an online questionnaire from the Google docs, while the
quantitative data were extracted from the Moodle logs. The participants for the online questionnaire
were same students who are part of quantitative research. The Moodle log data was collected as a
comma separated valuesﬁle (csv) and a Structured Query Language (SQL)ﬁle for analysis. The par-
ticipants were made aware that their identiﬁcation, responses to the questionnaire, and Moodle logs
would be conﬁdential. The student activities on the course website or course shell were tracked
through the Moodle log system. Moodle log stores the click history of each student, that is, it
stores the user identiﬁcation number, login frequency and the start and end time of the topics.
Through Moodle, students can access course information, class presentations, and activities. It is
also used to administer tests, quizzes and to facilitate class discussions. This project received
ethics approval from the university’s ethics committee for the use of student data.
Content analysis was used to analyze the data gathered from the questionnaire, and SQL and Excel
with SPSS were used to analyze the data collected from Moodle logs. Content analysis allowed us to see
the closed questions in the questionnaire in a better way where the remarks explain the responses.
The ﬁt-for-purpose research for this study was an inductive one where we began with a speciﬁc
observation, which led to a hypothesis. The reasons for adopting the inductive approach was that it
takes into account the context where research eﬀort is active, and it is also most appropriate for

Over 3 million records were retrieved from the Moodle log data in SQL format. Due to the chaotic
nature of the log data, data cleaning and data reduction processes were performed using SQL and
Microsoft Excel. Upon completion of the processes, a sample of 873 students was obtained to rep-
resent the population. The variable, Total_Frequency was obtained by adding the number of times
the students had accessed a particular topic. In a similar manner, the second variable, Total_Duration
was calculated by taking the sum of the time spent on each topic.Table 2illustrates the range (low-
high impact) of the two variables selected from Moodle at The University of the South Paciﬁc. Stu-
dents who complete up to 6 topics only and attempt 6 or less activities have less chance of attaining
a pass grade in the course. Thus, a low-high cutoﬀ value of 6 was selected. Theﬁnal results analysis
was obtained from the course coordinator to identify theﬁnal grades of the students.

to accept the null hypothesis (i.e.p = .000 < .05), thus, concluding that there is a signiﬁcant association
between each of the two variables and theﬁnal marks.
Finally in Step 6, a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was utilized toﬁnd a model that could be used
to predict the ﬁnal mark and also predict a causal relationship between the factors and
ﬁnal marks. The MLR modeling showed an adjustedR2 = 0.579, which meant that 57.9% of the vari-

total frequency and total duration equal to zero then his/herﬁnal marks can be at most 15.88. The
constant in the regression model is due to the fact that students who do not have any online pres-
ence in the course can still achieve some marks by attending the face-to-face components where the
topic activities are normally assessed by the facilitators during the class itself.

handle or stem of the slingshot signiﬁes the blended learning environment where the 2 main indi-
cators of online presence from this research study– frequency and duration are incorporated as
the two branches from the stem. The two ends of the rubber strip tied to the branches signify the
importance of these 2 indicators. The end with more knots around the branch is denoted as thefre-
quency constantwhich is taken from analytics to be from the more eﬀective indicator (frequency)o f
student ﬁnal marks between the two measurements. We note that the frequency measurement
incorporates all the lessons and online activities of the blended course. On the other hand, the
end with less knots is denoted as theduration constant which is taken from analytics to be from
the lesser eﬀective indicator (duration) of studentﬁnal marks between the two measurements. We
note that the duration measurement incorporates all lessons but 5 out of the 13 online activities
only. More knots indicate a high tension in the rubber strip which in turn stems a greater contribution

A 3D plot of the predictive model is presented inFigure 8. The model shows that frequency and
duration are statistically signiﬁcant indicators of students’ performance in a blended course in higher
education in the Paciﬁc.
A newly proposedSlingshot modelgiven inFigure 9conceptualizes the results of this research. The
handle or stem of the slingshot signiﬁes the blended learning environment where the 2 main indi-
cators of online presence from this research study– frequency and duration are incorporated as
the two branches from the stem. The two ends of the rubber strip tied to the branches signify the
importance of these 2 indicators. The end with more knots around the branch is denoted as thefre-
quency constantwhich is taken from analytics to be from the more eﬀective indicator (frequency)o f
student ﬁnal marks between the two measurements. We note that the frequency measurement
incorporates all the lessons and online activities of the blended course. On the other hand, the
end with less knots is denoted as theduration constant which is taken from analytics to be from
the lesser eﬀective indicator (duration) of studentﬁnal marks between the two measurements. We
note that the duration measurement incorporates all lessons but 5 out of the 13 online activities
only. More knots indicate a high tension in the rubber strip which in turn stems a greater contribution"

his/her online presence. However, it does not mean that higher frequency and duration would guar-
antee better marks, it would depend on the impact factor of variables given inTable 2. Therefore, the

have underperformed.
As outlined above, the analysis also show that theTotal_Frequency has a stronger linear relation-
ship on students’ performance compared toTotal_Duration. The factors contributing to this are:
(1) Reinforced learning through re-visits. The number of times a student accesses a topic leads to learn-
ing through reinforcement, which allows a permanent change in one’s behavior. Lessons could
allow more than one attempt to encourage students to gain better marks or provide additional
supplementary notes in the form of videos which are accessed through the topics/lessons.
(2) Multiple attempts – most LMS include tools that allow students to attempt online assessments
multiple times. Performance of students who attempt online assessments multiple times is
better than those who attempt only once (Orchard2016).
(3) Ine ﬀective learning time– some students may have a huge diﬀerence in the log-in and the log-
out times leading to a greaterTotal_Duration, but they may not be engaged in quality learning
during this time, that is, the student may be involved in other unproductive activities such as
watching movies or social networking.
Signiﬁcance of the model
The Slingshot model builds on a number of relevant work on blended learning in the literature.
Moore (1989) argued that student interaction (learner-content, learner-instructor, and learner-
learner interaction) is of central importance in a distance or an online environment. Delialioglu
and Yildirim (2007) used the frequency counts and activity durations to support theﬁndings from
log data on students’ perception for eﬀective dimensions of interactive learning. It was seen in
Staker and Horn (2012) that time, place, path, and pace are the 4 critical elements of blended learn-
ing. Finally, Mödritscher, Andergassen, and Neumann (2013) emphasized that the number of active
learning days and topic views are important variables to measure the student performance in
blended learning, while Yu and Jo (2014) conﬁrmed that duration in LMS has a positive impact on
student performance in courses in higher education. However, due to diﬀerent learning styles,
resource availability and unique cultural norms in the Paciﬁc, the most appropriate variables to
capture student eﬀectiveness in a blended learning environment in higher education are frequency
and duration which have been proved through the prediction model constructed from the student
data on Moodle. The positive coeﬃcients on Total_Frequency and Total_Duration in the model
suggest that regularly accessing course topics and spending adequate learning time on the topics
lead to enhanced student performance. In addition, the low and high impact factors of the 2 inde-
pendent variables and their importance in the blended learning environment further reﬂect the eﬀec-
tiveness of online presence.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to investigate the eﬀectiveness of online presence on student perform-
ance in the blended mode of study in higher education in the Paciﬁc. The 2 measures of online pres-
ence, the number of times a topic is accessed (Total_Frequency) and the total amount of time spent
on a topic (Total_Duration), were selected as the main predictors of student performance using cor-
relation analysis. These two variables were selected in this study because they are amongst the most

2019 - Effectiveness of online presence in a blended higher learning environment in the Pacific.pdf,"By looking at the questionnaire, through open-ended questions it was found that the 4 measures
related to the study is as follows:
(1) Internet and Intranet usage (ICT comfortability) in Paciﬁc
(2) Virtual learning environment (Moodle) usage in Paciﬁc?
(3) Course Delivery eﬀectiveness?
(4) Course learning expectation by students in Paciﬁc?
The results show a higher mean for each question averaging 4. This high value indicates that stu-
dents are comfortable with using Information & Communication technology. In addition, students are
also comfortable in using Learning Management System such as MOODLE. Moreover, students indi-
cated a positive response towards the eﬀectiveness of the online delivery of the blended course.
Lastly, students felt that overall the course met the students learning expectation.
Overall, students showed a highly positive response towards all four elements of ICT. Since stu-
dents had a highly positive response, it can be deduced that students were able to adapt well to
the online delivery of the blended course.
The quantitative research results show that there is a statistically signiﬁcant positive correlation
between Total_Frequency and Total_Duration, Total_Frequency and Final_Marks and Total_Duration
and Final_Marks. The ﬁndings suggest that students who have higherTotal_Frequency and Total_-
Duration achieve better grades in the blended course. Theﬁndings can be further explained by
the Online Measureable Presence Model (OMPM) shown inFigure 10 which consists of 2 elements
crucial in increasing the student commitment, retention and overall online fulﬁllment towards the
ﬁnal performance in a blended environment. The new model is inspired by the CSU Online Learning
& Teaching Model designed by Charles Sturt University in 2014 and adds frequency and duration as
key components of blended courses (Charles Sturt University2017). The model proposes how well a
student will perform in a blended learning environment based on his/her individual contributions to
the 2 measurements of eﬀective online presence. The model designed based on the results of this
study is described next.
In order to shift levels in the OMPM the students need to aim for higher impact factors for the two
variables of eﬀective online presence. In some instances, with the inclusion of the higher impact
factors students will be able to skip levels of OMPM. To move from low frequency and low duration
to low frequency and moderate duration, students will have to be actively involved in activities that
inculcate deep learning. Students need to spend time reading and understanding the concepts and
watching video lessons incorporated within the lessons. As seen from the mountainous terrain

To move levels from low frequency and moderate duration to moderate frequency and moderate

Finally, to move levels from the moderate frequency and moderate duration to high frequency

stand the concepts. Also multi-attempts to activities and re-visits to lessons are needed to better
understand the concepts and perform better. Students need to balance their course workload

provide suitable interventions to remove the obstacles. These will allowﬂexible and continuous

Moodle posts and SMS, and also implement strategies to ensure the students spend a reasonable
amount of time working on each topic. The latter for the Paciﬁc blended learning can include:
. Giving extra credit for viewing/participating in modules that help students to become successful
online learners.
. Contacting students who have not logged in for a while and enquiring if they are facing some
