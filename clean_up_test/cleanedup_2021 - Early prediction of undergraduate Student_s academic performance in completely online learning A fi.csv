ABSTRACT  
This decade, e-learning systems provide more interactivity to instructors and students than traditional systems 
and make possible a completely online (CO) education. However, instructors could not warn if a CO student is 
engaged or not in the course, and they could not predict his or her academic performance in courses. This work 
provides a collection of models (exploratory factor analysis, multiple linear regressions, cluster analysis, and 
correlation) to early predict the academic performance of students. These models are constructed using Moodle 
interaction data, characteristics, and grades of 802 undergraduate students from a CO university. The models 
result indicated that the major contribution to the prediction of the academic student performance is made by 
four factors: Access, Questionnaire, Task, and Age. Access factor is composed by variables related to accesses of 
students in Moodle, including visits to forums and glossaries. Questionnaire factor summarizes variables related 
to visits and attempts in questionnaires. Task factor is composed of variables related to consulted and submitted 
tasks. The Age factor contains the student age. Also, it is remarkable that Age was identified as a negative 
predictor of the performance of students, indicating that the student performance is inversely proportional to 
age. In addition, cluster analysis found five groups and sustained that number of interactions with Moodle are 
closely related to performance of students.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, it is widely accepted that e-learning systems provide 
more interactivity and flexibility since it is possible to use them anytime 
in different devices and locations ( Chen, Myers, & Yaron, 2000 ). Espe -
cially, these systems are utilized for online and blended universities by 
instructors to transmit, organize and provide educational contents to 
students. However, online instructors do not have complete information 
about students ’ behavior and academic performance as face-to-face 
(F2F) instructors do. For example, F2F instructors can adapt their ex -
planations when they feel that students could have failures in their 
learning process, because these instructors have constant visual contact 
to students. Then, they can interact continuously with students. How -
ever, an online instructor can virtually interact with students since an 
online course typically contains weekly tasks, which are also continu -
ously read and evaluated by online instructors. The problem is that this 
online supervision should have a high amount of communication and 
feedback, but this practice is carried out very rarely. Moreover, de -
scriptions of experience show that a supervision key of 1:10 is sufficient 
to ensure that the quality of online supervision is indistinguishable from 
the F2F supervision for the same work intensity of the teacher, but this 
supervision key is usually larger than 1:10 in online teaching. 
Currently, e-learning is implemented in everyday university life, as 
the advantages are well known: temporal independence, organization of 
the learning process, illustration, and redundancy. In fact, universities 
use Learning Management Systems (LMS) to provide blended or 
completely online (CO) learning. LMS store a vast quantity of data about 
interactions of students in log files. These files usually contain variables 
in the data such as the number of logins, number of accesses to elements 
of an online course, number of assignments completed, number of days 
in the online course, activities grades, term grade, course grade and so

This decade, e-learning systems provide more interactivity to instructors and students than traditional systems

provides a collection of models (exploratory factor analysis, multiple linear regressions, cluster analysis, and

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, it is widely accepted that e-learning systems provide 
more interactivity and flexibility since it is possible to use them anytime 
in different devices and locations. Espe -
cially, these systems are utilized for online and blended universities by 
instructors to transmit, organize and provide educational contents to 
students. However, online instructors do not have complete information 
about students ’ behavior and academic performance as face-to-face 
(F2F) instructors do. For example, F2F instructors can adapt their ex -
planations when they feel that students could have failures in their 
learning process, because these instructors have constant visual contact 
to students. Then, they can interact continuously with students. How -
ever, an online instructor can virtually interact with students since an 
online course typically contains weekly tasks, which are also continu-
ously read and evaluated by online instructors. The problem is that this 
online supervision should have a high amount of communication and 
feedback, but this practice is carried out very rarely. Moreover, de -
scriptions of experience show that a supervision key of 1:10 is sufficient

on. These data could be interesting for online instructors since they 
could contain information about behavior of the students that could 
influence in their academic performance. In other words, it is useful to 
know which variables are related to student performance, and then in -
structors could trigger actions to improve the learning process of stu -
dents. However, it is important to highlight that CO students are 
particularly different from F2F students. For example, CO students could 
be aged from 18 to 70 years old while F2F students usually are aged from 
18 to 23 years old. This fact creates a special diversity in CO instruction. 
This paper provides insights whether this diversity of students ’ profile 
could influence in the academic performance. 
Early Warning Systems (EWS) utilize data mining methods to detect 
students at risk of failure of courses in different education levels and 
contexts ( Howard, Meehan, & Parnell, 2018 ). According to Knowles 
(2015) , Early Warning Indicators (EWI) provide instructors with an 
advanced warning that students need help in their learning process. 
These systems contain predictive models with a collection of variables 
that are related to EWI. These variables usually contain information 
about demographic and institutional data, student characteristics, term 
or mid-term grades, and LMS interaction data. The Wisconsin Dropout 
Early Warning System (DEWS) is a successful development that provides 
instructors a forward-looking view of student performance ( Knowles, 
2015 ). However, a limitation in DEWS is that it is able to utilize de -
mographic and institutional data, student characteristics, term grades, 
but no able to utilize LMS interaction data and it is only utilized in F2F 
education. Other successful development of EWS is in Purdue University 
( Sclater, Peasgood, Mullan, 2016 ). This system is based on prediction 
models using the student performance, LMS student interaction, and 
prior academic history and student characteristics to predict student 
performance. This system represents each predicted student perfor -
mance as a traffic light, using red signal (unsuccessful performance), 
yellow signal (potential problems in the performance), and green (suc -
cessful performance). 
The present research is carried out at the Madrid Open University 
(UDIMA). This university provides a CO teaching to students. It offers 
CO undergraduate and graduate courses in different topics such as: Law, 
Criminology, Computer Science, Civil Engineering, Business Adminis -
tration, Economy, Journalism, History, Psychology, and Education. It is 
important to note that every UDIMA course has the same methodology 
and similar structure. Specifically, each course is composed by 10 
learning units and a set of activities. The UDIMA utilizes the LMS Moodle 
to transmit and organize educational contents of all courses. It means 
that every instructor can provide students with educational content, 
tasks, tests, videos, lessons, and so on. Also, the system stores log data 
about student interaction, student grades and activities submitted, test 
attempts, etc. It is important to note that the UDIMA students are 
enrolled in three courses per semester on average. 
The present research has three main research goals: to identify the 
variables that influence students ’ academic performance in the target 
course (G1), to identify the variables that influence students ’ academic 
performance in subsequent four years to achieve early prediction (G2), 
and to describe typology of students based on their interactions with the 
LMS (G3). 
2. Theory 
Several works have been done recently to predict academic perfor -
mance based on LMS data. One challenge that it is noted is the difficulty 
of finding a set of variables that can consistently predict student per -
formance across multiple courses ( Conijn, Snijders, Kleingeld, & Matzat, 
2017 ). One of the reasons for this difficulty is that instructional condi -
tions could influence the predictions of academic success based on log 
files of LMS ( Ga ˇsevi ´c, Dawson, Rogers, & Gasevic, 2016 ). The students 
may use different LMS features and there may be differences in how and 
the extent to which the LMS tools are utilized. 
Another relevant research result is that more elaborate theoretical 
reasoning is needed in learning analytics to achieve generalizable results 
( Conijn et al., 2017 ). That is to say, researchers need to use meaningful 
measures from log files that are congruent with learning and instruc -
tional theories. The theory of self-regulation learning has been used as 
theoretical grounding ( Ga ˇsevi ´c et al., 2016 ; You, 2016 ). The use of this 
theory implies that indicators that reflect regular study and 
time-management-related behaviors should be given more attention and 
be further investigated ( You, 2016 ). 
According to the theory of self-regulation learning, it could be useful 
to measure the time that students devote to the accomplishment of the 
learning activities. In fact, the indicator elapsed time has been consid -
ered for modeling the student performance in several studies 
( Pe ˜na-Ayala, 2014 ). However, time has not proved to be a significant 
variable to predict student performance in all cases. In a study about the 
use of discussion forums as an indicator of student performance 
( Romero, L ´opez, Luna, & Ventura, 2013 ), the number of messages is one 
of the most important attributes and the total time in the forum is one of 
the least relevant attributes. The results of a study on the relationship 
between log data and cognitive activities are even more revealing 
( Lerche & Kiel, 2018 ). The time spent editing a wiki did not contribute to 
explaining the performance because the texts of the wiki are created 
within a local word processor, so that students do not need to be con -
nected to the LMS to create wiki content, they only connect to it to copy 
and paste the text created locally. Therefore, these results suggest that 
modeling the time spent on a task might be a decision that depends on 
the instructional design and the characteristics of the used LMS. 
Another issue to consider when predicting academic performance is 
the cost of measuring each variable. Variables expensive to measure 
limit the generalizability of the results ( Sandoval, Gonzalez, Alarcon, 
Pichara, & Montenegro, 2018 ). An example of a variable expensive to 
measure is the elaborated time-based measure regular study used in You 
(2016) . In a course where the main materials were instructional videos, 
this variable was calculated tracking the time point when the student 
first encountered the video and the length of visualization time. Each 
student received a score per week. No point was given if the student did 
not access the instructional video within the scheduled time period, and 
a half point was given when the students accessed the content but did 
not finish watching the video. One point was given a student watched 
the weekly assigned videos from beginning to end within the scheduled 
week. 
Besides, most of the studies have not been conducted in CO degrees. 
Studies are taken place in campus-based universities with some online 
courses ( You, 2016 ; Lerche & Kiel, 2018 ), blended courses ( Conijn et al., 
2017 ; Ga ˇsevi ´c et al., 2016 ; Sandoval et al., 2018 ; Agudo-Peregrina, 
Iglesias-Pradas, Conde-Gonz ´alez, & Hern ´andez-García, 2014 ), and even 
within online assignments in a F2F course ( Cerezo, S ´anchez-Santill ´an, 
Paule-Ruiz, & Nú ˜nez, 2016 ). Therefore, the students ’ interactions with 
the LMS features in these contexts will be different than in a CO course. 
Finally, a key requirement in an online setting is to be able to do an 
early prediction of the academic performance to appropriately address 
students ’ weaknesses ( Lu et al., 2018 ). Two approaches can be founded 
in the literature. The first one is to do an early prediction of the academic 
performance at the end of a semester ( You, 2016 ; Lu et al., 2018 ). In this 
case, data from LMS are typically gathered from week 1 to week 6. The 
second one is to do an early prediction at the end of a degree, when a 
student finishes it ( Xu, Moon, & Schaar, 2017 ). In this case, data from 
the LMS are gathered during the first semester of the degree. 
The research herein was performed in a CO university, which shares 
a common instructional design between all the offered degrees, which 
distinguishes this study from previous ones, carried out in blended 
scenarios with different instructional designs. 
The independent variables have been selected for the study in 
accordance with our instructional design, which is primarily composed 
of questionnaires, forums, and tasks. Therefore, according to ( Lerche & 
Kiel, 2018 ) we have not considered measuring the time spent on tasks or 
Moodle questionnaires since both activities are usually done offline, 
J. Bravo-Agapito et al.","on. These data could be interesting for online instructors since they 
could contain information about behavior of the students that could 
influence in their academic performance. In other words, it is useful to 
know which variables are related to student performance, and then in -
structors could trigger actions to improve the learning process of stu -
dents. However, it is important to highlight that CO students are 
particularly different from F2F students. For example, CO students could 
be aged from 18 to 70 years old while F2F students usually are aged from 
18 to 23 years old. This fact creates a special diversity in CO instruction. 
This paper provides insights whether this diversity of students ’ profile 
could influence in the academic performance.

students at risk of failure of courses in different education levels and 
contexts ( Howard, Meehan, & Parnell, 2018 ). According to Knowles 
(2015) , Early Warning Indicators (EWI) provide instructors with an

outside the LMS. In other words, this variable could not be measured 
through the logs of an LMS. On the other hand, consistent with the re -
sults of Romero et al. (2013) , we have not considered the time spent in 
forums, but we have considered the number of accesses to the forum and 
the number of messages added to it. 
In addition, we use low-cost variables that do not require active 
effort for data collection or elaborated measures. The common instruc -
tional conditions and the use of low-cost variables improve the gener -
alizability of our study. Besides, we use an early prediction approach 
that allows us to predict academic performance at the end of a complete 
degree. 
3. Material and methods 
3.1. Sample 
The sample was composed by 802 students: 377 females and 425 
males. They were all students of UDIMA in Spain. Data of students ’ 
interaction with the LMS were collected from four courses in the aca -
demic year 2012 – 2013. In addition, to perform the early prediction, 
longitudinal data of academic achievement was gathered during the 
years 2013 – 2014, 2014 – 2015, 2015 – 2016, and 2016 – 2017. The courses 
selected were: Knowledge Management (N = 151, which is 18.8% of the 
sample), General Sociology (N = 135, 16.8%), Information Technology 
and Communication (N = 157, 19.6%) and Learning and Information 
Technologies (N = 359, 44.8%). Criteria of course selection were: first, 
that were of the first semester to make the early prediction, second that 
they were transversal and obligatory so that we had a representation of 
all the degrees. The age of participants ranges from 21 to 70 years old 
(m = 36.54; s.d. = 10.14). Distribution according the university degree 
was: 2% Economy, 26% Criminology, 4.5% Civil Engineering, 2% Hu -
manities, 7% Tourism, 10.6% Psychology, 6% Computer Science, 11% 
Business Administration, 10% Journalism, 3.5% History, 13.7% Law, 
and 11.5% Labor Science. 
3.2. Data collection and variables 
Courses on UDIMA has a common structure: all courses consist of 10 
didactic units and several activities including 3 to 6 forums or glossaries, 
2 to 6 questionnaires (with 2 attempts each one) and 2 to 6 assignments. 
Table 1 list the variables included in the present research, all the 
variables were measured at the end of the academic semester, X

to X
16 
are independent variables obtained from Moodle log files, and X
17 
to X
19 
are independent variables obtained from the student profile in the ac -
ademic system of UDIMA. It is worth pointing out that the academic 
system of UDIMA did not provide us prior knowledge data and personal 
data of students such as if a student has a job, family, health issue, etc., 
since it is not mandatory to collect these data from students in UDIMA. 
Y

are grades of each academic year and are dependent variables 
and are obtained by the academic system of UDIMA. The extraction of 
the Moodle log files was carried out using an ad hoc computer appli -
cation developed by the authors of the present work. 
It is important to point out that grade point average (GPA) is 
calculated as it is showed in (1) . In this formula, CG
i 
represents the grade 
of course i; W
i 
is the number of credits of course i; W
T 
is the number of 
passed credits; i = 1 indicates the first academic year; L indicates the 
highest academic year. For example, let say that the student S

passed 30 
credits with the following courses grades and credits: 7.5 (6 credits), 8 (6 
credits), 5 (3 credits), 6 (3 credits), 9.5 (6 credits), 6.7 (6 credits). Then, 
GPA for S
1 
is 7.44. Therefore, GPA in our study is ranged from 5 to 10.

3.3. Design and data analysis 
Five-year data were included in order to develop an early prediction 
of the academic performance. We set significance level of 0.05 for all 
analyses. Data analysis included several procedures, detailed below:  
1) Description of variables: a complete description of the 16 variables 
extracted from the log files was made in order to characterize the 
students ’ behavior in the LMS and also to test the assumptions of the 
regression models. This analysis includes Pearson correlation matrix 
to test collinearity.  
2) Factor analysis: as most of the variables extracted from the log files 
are highly correlated an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was 
conducted using Principal Component Analysis with varimax rota -
tion to reduce the number of independent variables to factors more 
interpretable and not correlated. The input for EFA was the Pearson 
correlations matrix between the 16 variables extracted from the log 
files. This matrix was examined using the Bartlett test of Sphericity 
KMO index and Measures of Sample Adequacy. To decide the num -
ber of factors to retain a mixed approach was employed ( Ruscio & 
Roche, 2012 ), combining scree test with optimal coordinates and 
parallel analysis with 500 simulated resamples ( Horn, 1965 ).

J. Bravo-Agapito et al.","outside the LMS. In other words, this variable could not be measured 
through the logs of an LMS. On the other hand, consistent with the re -
sults of Romero et al. (2013) , we have not considered the time spent in 
forums, but we have considered the number of accesses to the forum and 
the number of messages added to it. 
In addition, we use low-cost variables that do not require active 
effort for data collection or elaborated measures. The common instruc -
tional conditions and the use of low-cost variables improve the gener -
alizability of our study. Besides, we use an early prediction approach 
that allows us to predict academic performance at the end of a complete 
degree. 
3. Material and methods 
3.1. Sample 
The sample was composed by 802 students: 377 females and 425 
males. They were all students of UDIMA in Spain. Data of students ’ 
interaction with the LMS were collected from four courses in the aca -
demic year 2012 – 2013. In addition, to perform the early prediction, 
longitudinal data of academic achievement was gathered during the 
years 2013 – 2014, 2014 – 2015, 2015 – 2016, and 2016 – 2017. The courses 
selected were: Knowledge Management (N = 151, which is 18.8% of the 
sample), General Sociology (N = 135, 16.8%), Information Technology 
and Communication (N = 157, 19.6%) and Learning and Information 
Technologies (N = 359, 44.8%). Criteria of course selection were: first, 
that were of the first semester to make the early prediction, second that 
they were transversal and obligatory so that we had a representation of 
all the degrees. The age of participants ranges from 21 to 70 years old 
(m = 36.54; s.d. = 10.14). Distribution according the university degree 
was: 2% Economy, 26% Criminology, 4.5% Civil Engineering, 2% Hu -
manities, 7% Tourism, 10.6% Psychology, 6% Computer Science, 11% 
Business Administration, 10% Journalism, 3.5% History, 13.7% Law, 
and 11.5% Labor Science. 
3.2. Data collection and variables 
Courses on UDIMA has a common structure: all courses consist of 10 
didactic units and several activities including 3 to 6 forums or glossaries, 
2 to 6 questionnaires (with 2 attempts each one) and 2 to 6 assignments. 
Table 1 list the variables included in the present research, all the 
variables were measured at the end of the academic semester, X

16 
are independent variables obtained from Moodle log files, and X
17

are independent variables obtained from the student profile in the ac -
ademic system of UDIMA. It is worth pointing out that the academic 
system of UDIMA did not provide us prior knowledge data and personal 
data of students such as if a student has a job, family, health issue, etc., 
since it is not mandatory to collect these data from students in UDIMA.

are grades of each academic year and are dependent variables 
and are obtained by the academic system of UDIMA. The extraction of 
the Moodle log files was carried out using an ad hoc computer appli -
cation developed by the authors of the present work. 
It is important to point out that grade point average (GPA) is 
calculated as it is showed in (1) . In this formula, CG
i 
represents the grade 
of course i; W
i 
is the number of credits of course i; W
T 
is the number of 
passed credits; i = 1 indicates the first academic year; L indicates the 
highest academic year. For example, let say that the student S
1 
passed 30 
credits with the following courses grades and credits: 7.5 (6 credits), 8 (6 
credits), 5 (3 credits), 6 (3 credits), 9.5 (6 credits), 6.7 (6 credits). Then, 
GPA for S
1 
is 7.44. Therefore, GPA in our study is ranged from 5 to 10. 
3.3. Design and data analysis 
Five-year data were included in order to develop an early prediction 
of the academic performance. We set significance level of 0.05 for all 
analyses. Data analysis included several procedures, detailed below:  
1) Description of variables: a complete description of the 16 variables 
extracted from the log files was made in order to characterize the 
students ’ behavior in the LMS and also to test the assumptions of the 
regression models. This analysis includes Pearson correlation matrix 
to test collinearity.  
2) Factor analysis: as most of the variables extracted from the log files 
are highly correlated an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was 
conducted using Principal Component Analysis with varimax rota -
tion to reduce the number of independent variables to factors more 
interpretable and not correlated. The input for EFA was the Pearson 
correlations matrix between the 16 variables extracted from the log 
files. This matrix was examined using the Bartlett test of Sphericity 
KMO index and Measures of Sample Adequacy. To decide the num -
ber of factors to retain a mixed approach was employed ( Ruscio & 
Roche, 2012 ), combining scree test with optimal coordinates and 
parallel analysis with 500 simulated resamples ( Horn, 1965 ). 
3) Multiple linear regressions: a multiple regression model was esti -
mated by the method of maximum likelihood to meet two of the 
research goals: (G1) to identify the variables that influence students ’ 
academic performance in the target course (Y
1
) and (G2) to test the 
influence of those independent variables on the average final grade 
of the subsequent academic years from academic course 2012 – 2013

to 2016 – 2017 (Y
2 
to Y
6
). As predictor variables were used the factors 
identified in the EFA and the only continuous sociodemographic 
variable (age).  
4) Cluster analysis: in order to achieve the third goal (G3) a cluster 
analysis was performed. This analysis was made following a tech -
nique that combines factorial methods and cluster analysis in four 
steps ( Lebart, Morineau, & Piron, 2000 ). First, a Principal Compo -
nent Analysis (PCA) was made with the continuous variables ( Hus -
son, L ˆe, & Pag `es, 2010 ). Second, an agglomerative hierarchical 
classification was made using Ward ’ s method ( Pardo & Del Campo, 
2007 ). Third, a classification through mobile centers was made using 
the K-Means method; in addition, the validation of the identified 
groups was made using hypothesis testing. Finally, the description of 
each group was made using the continuous and categorical variables. 
If the variables are continuous, the average of each group is 
compared with the general average and, if the variable is categorical, 
the percentages are compared using v.test statistic ( Husson, L ˆe, & 
Pag `es, 2010 ). 
Data analysis was carried out with R v.3.2.4 ( The R Development 
Core Team, 2018 ). EFA and cluster analysis were made using the Fac -
torMineR v.1.32 ( Husson, Josse, & Le, 2016 ). The remaining analysis 
was made in Jamovi ( The jamovi project, 2019 ). 
3.4. Procedure 
The present research was developed in six phases. In the first phase 
the distribution and correlation of the 16 variables extracted from the 
log files were analyzed, in the second phase the EFA was made, finding 
three factors: Access Factor (AF), Questionnaire Factor (QF) and Task 
Factor (TF) that will be explained in the results section. The third phase 
consisted in an exploratory analysis of the three factors conformed by 
the EFA in order to detect outliers and to analyze their distribution. The 
process of elimination of outliers was as follow: a) the descriptive sta -
tistics of the distributions including quartiles, boxplot and skewness/ 
kurtosis were calculated, b) the outliers were eliminated using the 
boxplot and the quartiles (outliers were mainly values that were above 
the 75th percentile, that is, extremely high values of the variables), c) 
specifically, we eliminated cases with values greater than 3000 in AF, 
greater than 250 in QF and greater than 130 in TF. The boxplots and 
distribution histograms of the factors after elimination of outliers will be 
presented in the result section. 
The fourth phase was the prediction of the performance in the spe -
cific course (Y
1
). In the data pre-processing 20 cases were detected as 
outliers and removed from the sample, so, results for this initial analysis 
were based on 782 students. In the fifth phase we made predictions of 
the academic performance on each subsequent academic year (Y
2 
to Y
6
) 
with a reduced sample of 525 valid cases: 593 students finished their 
studies (183 students abandoned) and 68 cases were detected as outliers. 
The sixth phase was to perform the cluster analysis. 
4. Results 
4.1. Description of data 
4.1.1. Distributions 
As can be seen in Table 2 , the independent variables exhibit great 
dispersion, positive skewness and they are leptokurtic (except total of 
assignments). 
4.1.2. Correlations 
Table 3 shows almost consistently significant correlations. For that 
reason, and also due to the skewed and leptokurtic form of the distri -
butions presented in Table 2 we decide to perform an EFA. This EFA 
checks in advance whether some of the variables extracted from the log 
files could be better represented in a series of combined factors, more 
stable against individual outliers and thus against incorrect forecast. 
4.2. Exploratory factor analysis 
4.2.1. Adequacy of the analysis 
Barlett ’ s test ( χ
2 
= 14868; df = 120; p < .001) indicates the accep -
tance of null hypothesis, then, it is adequate to perform the factor 
analysis. Table 4 presents the KMO index of sampling adequacy. The 
measures KMO indicate a high correlation between the variables 
(greater than 0.7) confirming the adequacy of performing the factor 
analysis. 
4.2.2. Selection of the number of factors to retain 
Following the scree plot of the parallel analysis (see Fig. 1 ), it can be 
seen that the variables can be summarized in three factors that explain 
70.9% of the variance (see Table 5 ). 
4.2.3. Factor loadings and composition of factors 
Once the three factors have been selected, we proceed to analyze the 
factorial loads that are presented in Table 6 . It can be observed that the 
independent variables could be reduced on three factors. The first factor 
can be called Questionnaire Factor (QF) because it summarizes 6 inde -
pendent variables: the frequency of accesses and attempts of question -
naires, the number of questions answered, the frequency of 
questionnaires visualization, the number of questionnaires submitted, 
and the number of questionnaires reviewed. The second factor is 
composed by 6 variables that are all related to accesses: total number of 
logins, the number of course accesses, the frequency of access to forums

and glossaries, the number of added messages to forums, and the fre -
quency that students visit didactic units. For this reason, we decided to 
call this factor Access Factor (AF). Finally, the third factor is made up of 
three variables related to the assignments (tasks): the total of assign -
ments performed, consulted, and submitted. Then, it has been decided to 
call it Task Factor (TF). 
It is important to note that the variable ""number of days until the first 
access to the classroom"" does not load in any factor and also has a 
uniqueness value greater than 0.8. For these reasons and for its biased 
distribution, we have decided not to include it in any factor. 
4.3. Description of factors 
Figs. 2 – 4 show the distributions of the QF, AF, and TF factors and 
their descriptive statistics are presented in Table 7 . The statistics of 
asymmetry and kurtosis, being less than 0.6, indicate that the distribu -
tions are not significantly biased nor have a high kurtosis. In addition, 
box plots not exhibit outliers. Although, the TF factor contains outliers, 
we do not remove these data as this factor already had adequate kurtosis 
levels and symmetry. 
4.4. Prediction of the academic performance in the course 
The multiple regression analysis was made with four independent 
variables: using the three factors identified in the EFA and incorporating 
age. It is important to note that age variable is the only quantitative 
demographic variable. Table 8 shows that all variables significantly 
predict the final grade of the course (Y
1
). It is worth noting that the age 
variable predicts negatively, which indicates that at more age less grade 
is obtained. In addition, multicollinearity was tested by tolerance values 
and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). There is no collinearity among 
variables since none of tolerance values are less than 0.1. Moreover, 
none of the VIF values are above 2.5 supporting no collinearity. 
Table 9 shows that the model fit is good and the four independent 
variables explains 45.5% of the variance of the students ’ academic 
performance in the target course. On the other hand, independence was 
tested with the Durbin-Watson statistic, in this case D.W. = 1.88 indi -
cating independence. 
4.4.1. Prediction of the academic performance in subsequent academic 
years 
Table 10 exhibits the model fit measures for the 2012/13, 2013/14, 
2014/15, 2015/16, and 2016/17 years. The model for the 2012/13 year 
explains 17,5% of the variance of the students ’ academic performance 
measured by the average grade of the academic year. The model for the 
2013/14 year explains 13.9% of the variance. The model for the 2014/ 
15 year explains 11.5% of the variance. For the 2015/16 year the model 
explains 11.2% of the variance, and for the 2016/17 year the model 
explains 10.04% of the variance. Likewise, the model fit is worse as the 
year progresses. Thus, the difference in BIC and AIC criteria each year is 
over 10 indicates a significant decrease in the model fit of the models.

coefficients, t values, p values, and collinearity statistics of the models 
corresponding to each academic year. From these data it can be seen that 
prediction accuracy descended each year. For instance, at the end of 
2012/13 the Task ceases to be a predictor of the performance, and at the 
end of 2013/14 the Access ceases. 
4.5. Cluster analysis 
The dendrogram shows that the students can be classified into five 
groups: the first is made up of 214 (36.1%), the second 205 (34.6%), the 
third by 87 (14.6%), the fourth by 27 (4.6%) and the last by 60 (10.2%) 
students. In Fig. 5 , the students and the group to which they belong are 
projected in the first factorial plane. 
With regards to cluster interpretation, it can be seen that there are 
five groups. These groups are described in the following lines: 
- Group 1: According to v.test this group is mainly composed by 
students of Computer Science, Journalism, and Psychology, the contin -
uous variables that characterize them are summarized in Table 12 . In 
this table we can see that it is a group that is characterized by having few 
interactions in the platform (they write few messages in the forums, 
enter with low frequency to the platform and the course, rarely access 
the questionnaires, do not access to course materials, submit few tasks, 
…) and lower grades both in the course and in subsequent years. Also, 
they are characterized by having a lower age. In Fig. 5 we can see this 
group at the left. 
- Group 2: Group two is mainly composed by Computer Science, 
Criminology, and Psychology students. The continuous variables that 
characterize them are summarized in Table 13 . In this table we can see 
that it is a group that is characterized by consulting and sending many 
assignments and they have a high frequency of viewing questionnaires. 
Their course grade is also high. However, their average grade in the 
academic year 2014/15 is lower than the overall mean. Also, they are 
characterized by having a lower age, lower frequency of logins and 
entries in the course, and poor participation in forums. In Fig. 5 we can 
see this group at the center. 
- Group 3: According to v.test this group is mainly composed by 
students of Civil Engineering. The continuous variables that characterize 
them are summarized in Table 14 . In this table we can see that it is a 
group that is characterized by their high access to didactic material, 
forums, glossaries, and their high participation in the forums. They are 
also characterized by having a higher grade in the course and in sub -
sequent years. Also, they are characterized by have a higher age. In 
Fig. 5 we can see this group at the right.

5. Discussion 
The results obtained provide information to meet the objectives 
outlined in the introduction of the present paper. On the one hand, we 
have found a group of variables that allows predicting the academic 
performance of a sample of undergraduate students using data collected 
from an LMS during an academic semester (G1 and G2). These variables 
may be considered as EWI in order to carry out preventive support 
measures. On the other hand, we analyzed the relationship between 
variables and developed a complete description of the five students ’ 
profiles that we found (G3). 
The factors that have been predictive in the short term (course) are 
Task (frequency of actions that each student performs with the Moodle 
tasks), Access (related to the frequency of logins, messages sent in the 
forums and access to educational material, forums and glossaries), 
Questionnaire (frequency of actions that each student performs with the 
Moodle questionnaires), and Age. 
Task is the factor that most contributes to the student performance in 
the course. This result makes sense because tasks are the most important 
assignments of the course, account for about twenty per cent of the final 
grade, require generally about 20 h to complete and have a deadline set 
in the course. 
The factor Access indicates that students who use Moodle more 
intensively and more frequently also receive higher grades. This result 
can be explained by the university instructional design, as instructors 
publish new materials in the virtual classroom on a weekly basis and 
reply to forums daily. Therefore, adequate study of the course requires 
access to the virtual classroom on a regular basis and examine the new 
educational material, forums, and glossaries. Furthermore, this result is 
in line with the works of Nistor and Neubauer (2010) and Romero et al. 
(2013) in relation to the positive relationship between the number of 
messages in the forums and academic performance. 
The factor Questionnaire is related to regular study. The question -
naires are usually made up of multiple-choice questions and serve to 
assess concept understanding. They are published at the beginning of the 
semester and closed at the end. Each student is given two attempts per 
questionnaire. In this way, learners who study the course on a regular 
basis take the questionnaires throughout the course and use the two 
attempts. Therefore, a high number of questionnaires could indicate a 
regular study. 
The composition of our prediction model could be explained by the 
theory of self-regulated online learning which proposed that online 
students who manage their time appropriately, are critical in examining 
the content and persevere in understanding the learning material are 
more likely to achieve higher academic grades in the online settings 
( Broadbent & Poon, 2015 ). 
Through the five-year analysis it is observed that the variables that 
positively influence long-term performance are the same to those that 
influence the short term (Access, Questionnaire, and Age) except Task. It 
is important to note that one of the variables that appears constantly in 
the models is Age, as a negative predictor of performance. This result

forum, and assignments. They are also characterized by having a higher 
use of questionnaires (views, attempts, submitted, access, question 
answered). In Fig. 5 we can see this group at the upper-right. 
5. Discussion 
The results obtained provide information to meet the objectives 
outlined in the introduction of the present paper. On the one hand, we 
have found a group of variables that allows predicting the academic 
performance of a sample of undergraduate students using data collected 
from an LMS during an academic semester (G1 and G2). These variables 
may be considered as EWI in order to carry out preventive support 
measures. On the other hand, we analyzed the relationship between 
variables and developed a complete description of the five students ’ 
profiles that we found (G3). 
The factors that have been predictive in the short term (course) are 
Task (frequency of actions that each student performs with the Moodle 
tasks), Access (related to the frequency of logins, messages sent in the 
forums and access to educational material, forums and glossaries), 
Questionnaire (frequency of actions that each student performs with the 
Moodle questionnaires), and Age. 
Task is the factor that most contributes to the student performance in 
the course. This result makes sense because tasks are the most important 
assignments of the course, account for about twenty per cent of the final 
grade, require generally about 20 h to complete and have a deadline set 
in the course. 
The factor Access indicates that students who use Moodle more 
intensively and more frequently also receive higher grades. This result 
can be explained by the university instructional design, as instructors 
publish new materials in the virtual classroom on a weekly basis and 
reply to forums daily. Therefore, adequate study of the course requires 
access to the virtual classroom on a regular basis and examine the new 
educational material, forums, and glossaries. Furthermore, this result is 
in line with the works of Nistor and Neubauer (2010) and Romero et al. 
(2013) in relation to the positive relationship between the number of 
messages in the forums and academic performance. 
The factor Questionnaire is related to regular study. The question -
naires are usually made up of multiple-choice questions and serve to 
assess concept understanding. They are published at the beginning of the 
semester and closed at the end. Each student is given two attempts per 
questionnaire. In this way, learners who study the course on a regular 
basis take the questionnaires throughout the course and use the two 
attempts. Therefore, a high number of questionnaires could indicate a 
regular study. 
The composition of our prediction model could be explained by the 
theory of self-regulated online learning which proposed that online 
students who manage their time appropriately, are critical in examining 
the content and persevere in understanding the learning material are 
more likely to achieve higher academic grades in the online settings 
( Broadbent & Poon, 2015 ). 
Through the five-year analysis it is observed that the variables that 
positively influence long-term performance are the same to those that 
influence the short term (Access, Questionnaire, and Age) except Task. It 
is important to note that one of the variables that appears constantly in 
the models is Age, as a negative predictor of performance. This result"

might be supported by the fact that cognitive mechanisms, necessary to 
learn something new, declines with age ( Ericsson, 2018 ; Park, Polk, 
Mikels, Taylor, & Marshuetz, 2001 ). 
Regarding the limitations of our prediction model, we did not 
consider personal student data in the initial set of variables (19 inde -
pendent variables). On one hand, Hattie (2009) indicates that the prior 
knowledge of learning is an interesting variable that could influence the 
student learning. On the other hand, Hattie (2009) found that the prior 
knowledge has less contribution to learning than other variables related 
to actions of students in classrooms. Then, we did not include the prior 
knowledge of learning in the initial set of variables since it is not 
mandatory that UDIMA collects these data. 
Following the third objective five clusters of students were clearly 
identified and validated. Only few previous researchers have employed 
this technique and it is one of the principal contributions of the present 
research. Group 1 is characterized by having few interactions in the 
LMS, lower grades both, in short and large term, and lower age. This 
group is similar to the cluster 4 found in the study of Cerezo et al. (2016) . 
Group 2 shows higher frequency of consults and submitting of assign -
ments, and a higher view of questionnaires. Their course grade is also 
high. Being focused on practical tasks, this group would be similar to 
cluster 3 of Cerezo et al. (2016) . Group 3 exhibits high frequency of 
access to teaching materials, forums, glossaries, and higher participation 
in forums. They have higher grades in short and long term, and higher 
age. This group may be similar to the cluster 2 of Cerezo et al. (2016) 
that also is characterized by their number of actions and frequency of 
access to teaching materials. Group 4 shows a high use of questionnaires 
and higher participation in the forums, logins, and entries in the course, 
but low participation in assignments. It is important to emphasize that a 
group with these characteristics was not found in the Cerezo et al. 
(2016) . Finally, the group 5 is characterized by higher frequency of 
access to teaching materials, forums, and assignments, being similar to 
the cluster 1 reported by Cerezo et al. (2016) . 
It is important to note the similarities between the results of the 
multiple regression and the cluster analysis as the groups that are 
characterized by higher grades (groups 2 and 3) are also the ones with 
the highest frequency of access to teaching materials, forums, glossaries, 
and higher participation in forums, and again, they are the ones who are 
older. These results are matching with previous studies that have also 
observed that academic performance is strongly determined by patterns 
of interactions that involve active participation ( Agudo-Peregrina et al., 
2014 ; G ´omez-Aguilar, Hern ´andez-García, García-Pe ˜nalvo, & Ther ´on, 
2015 ). An interesting peculiarity of group 2, focused on practical tasks, 
is that only exhibits a higher grade in the course, it seems to indicate an 
influence of tasks in the short term but not in the long term. It may be 
interesting to deepen this result in future research. Results of correlation 
analysis are also matching with those found in the cluster and regression 
analysis because all the variables correlate significantly and positively 
except the number of days to first access the virtual classroom. 
One contribution of the present work is that it is done in a university 
that is completely online in which all the courses share the same 
instructional design, which provides a great advantage for the early 
prediction because the variables can be interpreted in a similar way and 
we can include participants of different degrees. The results of the pre -
sent research may be used in other online universities that have similar 
instructional conditions (activities, didactic units, glossaries, question -
naires, … ). Another important contribution is that by obtaining similar 
results in the short and long term regression models we can identify the 
common predictor variables that may be considered as EWI in order to 
carry out preventive support measures as educational programs to 
promote self-regulation in the groups with detected problems (for 
example, younger students, who do not participated in forums, that 
submit few questionnaires and assignments, etc.). 
Notwithstanding the contributions of this research, it has an inherent 
limitation to the cluster since, due to its nature, it depends on the sample 
being analyzed, and so, the results of the present research are not 
generalizable to the population. 
6. Conclusions 
This work proposed a collection of models that could be useful to 
consistently predict the academic performance of students at the end of a 
degree. These models utilized variables of two data sources: LMS 
interaction data of students and institutional data that included infor -
mation of student enrollment, age and sex of students, and GPA of each 
academic year from 2012 to 2017. The models presented in this work 
make an early prediction using LMS students ’ interaction data of the first 
semester of the 2012 – 2013 academic courses. 
According to our results we found that the implications for online 
education are mainly related to intervention strategies. They should be 
designed to improve the students ’ academic performance in an early 
stage of their studies. 
Another contribution that it is important to emphasize is that the 
present research context was a CO university with degrees that share the 
same instructional approach. This uniformity between courses avoids 
possible measurement bias errors in our results. In addition, we have 
utilized variables that are grounded on the self-regulation online 
learning theory. These characteristics reinforce the generalizability of 
our models to similar online contexts.
