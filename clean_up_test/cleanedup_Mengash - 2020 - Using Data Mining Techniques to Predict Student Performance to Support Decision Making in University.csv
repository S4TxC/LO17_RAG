ABSTRACT An admissions system based on valid and reliable admissions criteria is very important
to select candidates likely to perform well academically at institutions of higher education. This study
focuses on ways to support universities in admissions decision making using data mining techniques to
predict applicants’ academic performance at university. A data set of 2,039 students enrolled in a Computer
Science and Information College of a Saudi public university from 2016 to 2019 was used to validate
the proposed methodology. The results demonstrate that applicants’ early university performance can be
predicted before admission based on certain pre-admission criteria (high school grade average, Scholastic
Achievement Admission Test score, and General Aptitude Test score). The results also show that Scholastic
Achievement Admission Test score is the pre-admission criterion that most accurately predicts future student
performance. Therefore, this score should be assigned more weight in admissions systems. We also found
that the Artiﬁcial Neural Network technique has an accuracy rate above 79%, making it superior to other
classiﬁcation techniques considered (Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Naïve Bayes).

I. INTRODUCTION
Today, all higher education institutions, especially computer
and engineering colleges, face challenges in the admissions
process. Each university should strive for an admissions sys-
tem based on valid and reliable admissions criteria that select
candidates likely to succeed in its programs. In addition,
each university should use the best possible techniques for
predicting applicants’ future academic performance before
admitting them. This would support university decision mak-
ers as they set efﬁcient admissions criteria.
However, most higher education institutions face chal-
lenges when they analyze their large educational databases
to predict students’ performance [1]. This is because they

is the process of extracting useful information and pat-
terns from a huge educational database [2], which can
then be used to predict students’ performance. As a
result of better information, student performance can be
more effectively improved through more effective strategic
programs.
In this context, this study focuses on supporting universi-

I. INTRODUCTION
Today, all higher education institutions, especially computer
and engineering colleges, face challenges in the admissions
process. Each university should strive for an admissions sys-
tem based on valid and reliable admissions criteria that select
candidates likely to succeed in its programs. In addition,
each university should use the best possible techniques for
predicting applicants’ future academic performance before
admitting them. This would support university decision mak-
ers as they set efﬁcient admissions criteria.
However, most higher education institutions face chal-
lenges when they analyze their large educational databases
to predict students’ performance [1]. This is because they
use only conventional statistical methods rather than new
and efﬁcient predictive techniques such as Educational Data
Mining (EDM), which is the most popular technique to
evaluate and predict students’ performance [2]–[6]. EDM
is the process of extracting useful information and pat-
terns from a huge educational database [2], which can
then be used to predict students’ performance. As a
result of better information, student performance can be
more effectively improved through more effective strategic
programs.
In this context, this study focuses on supporting universi-
ties in making admissions decisions through the application
of data mining techniques to better predict applicants’ aca-
demic performance before admission.
More speciﬁcally, this study addresses the following
questions:
1) Is it possible to identify the admission criterion that
most accurately predicts applicants’ future academic
performance?
2) Is it possible to predict applicants’ early academic
performance before admitting them based on their
pre-admission test scores?"

3) Which data mining prediction technique among Arti-
ﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Trees (DT),
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naïve Bayes
performs best in this study?
4) Do students’ ﬁrst-year academic performances
improve when more weight is assigned to the most
signiﬁcant admission criterion?
This study contributes to the literature in several ways.
First, we develop and test four predictive models using
data mining classiﬁcation techniques to predict early aca-
demic performance among applicants based on their pre-
admission proﬁles. The information in these proﬁles most
often used to predict student performance in higher educa-
tion includes quiz scores, ﬁnal exam scores, participation
in extra activities, student demography, overall grades, and
social network interactions (e.g. [7]–[10]). However, vari-
ables such as pre-admission test scores are rarely consid-
ered in the admissions process (e.g. [11]–[13]) to predict
future student performance. These underused metrics are
the focus of this study. In addition, we identify the best of
four classiﬁcation techniques to predict student performance
in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Measure
metrics.
Second, through a correlation coefﬁcient analysis,
we determine the relation between admissions criteria and
students’ Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) during
their ﬁrst year of study at university. We also identify admis-
sion criterion that most accurately predicts student perfor-
mance so that decision makers can assign more weight to this
particular criterion.
Third, based on the results and recommendations provided
by this study, the university where this study was conducted
decided to change the weighting of its admission criteria. This
study proved the efﬁcacy of such a decision by comparing
the ﬁrst-year CGPAs of new students admitted using the new
system to the ﬁrst-year CGPAs of students admitted using
the old system. The percentage of students who achieved
excellent or very good ﬁrst-year CGPAs increased by 31%,
and the percentage of the students who got acceptable or poor
ﬁrst-year CGPAs decreased by 18%.
Finally, this study differs from other studies in the ﬁeld
of predicting student performance because it had a large
sample size of 2,039 students of the College of Computer
and Information Sciences (CCIS) at Princess Nourah bint
Abdulrahman University (PNU), located in Riyadh, Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia (KSA). It is the largest university for women
in the world. Most of the work that has been done in this ﬁeld
uses much smaller sample sizes in their model performance
validation.
In our extensive search of research literature in KSA,
we found only one published study [14] in the ﬁeld of admis-
sions criteria analysis the role admissions criteria play in
predicting student performance in the computer science and
technology colleges of Saudi public universities. That study
addressed the relationship between pre-university exams and
student performance at university. However, it applied only
one statistical model (regression) that was not compared
to other signiﬁcant DM techniques. Also, the study used
data from only one department (the Information Technology
department) of the Computer College. In addition, the study’s
recommendations were not applied at the university where
the study was conducted, and so the study’s recommendations
were never tested.
To the best of our knowledge, the few other related studies
on this topic in KSA were focused exclusively on medical
school students (e.g. [11]–[13], [15]–[17]). In addition, these
studies used statistical software for data analysis rather than
EDM techniques.
In 2016, two studies [18] used EDM to predict the students
GPA based on their performance in previous courses, but
they have not addressed the relationship between the student
performance and university admission criteria.
We further detail the related work and research gap in
Section 2.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 details the related work and research gap.
Section 3 describes the domain of the study. Section 4
explains its methodology. Section 5 presents the experimental
evaluation. Section 6 outlines our conclusion, recommenda-
tions, and some potential future work.
II. RELATED WORK AND RESEARCH GAP
In higher learning institutions, student performance is the fac-
tor most important to a university’s quality. EDM is currently
the technique most commonly used by researchers to evaluate
and predict student performance due to its signiﬁcance in
decision making [3]–[7].
Predicting student performance has two main factors:
attributes and prediction methods [19]. It has been shown
in [19] that student CGPA is the most frequently used attribute
in predicting student performance at university. It has been
used in many researches (e.g. [7]–[10], [20]). Other attributes
commonly used by researches to predict student performance
at university are: assessments, quiz grades, lab work, and ﬁnal
exam grades (e.g. [8], [9], [21]). Few researches have used
other attributes like extra activities, student demography, and
social interaction network (e.g. [19], [22]).
However, input variables such as pre-admission tests are
rarely used (e.g. [11]–[13]) to predict student performance at
university in the admissions process. This is the focus of this
study.
Several data mining classiﬁcation techniques have been
applied for prediction of student performance. For example,
ANN is used in study [21] to predict the academic per-
formance of 505 students in their eighth semester. Regard-
ing Decision Trees, study [9] proposed a model to predict
student performance in certain courses using small student
sample sizes (32 and 42 students). Naïve Bayes is applied in
study [23] on a set of 1,600 students to predict performance
in a particular course. SVM is applied by study [24] on a data
set of 1,074 students to predict students at risk performance
in their ﬁrst year of study.

The analysis of the literature reveals that most available
studies do not explore the relationship between students’ pre-
admission exam scores and their expected academic perfor-
mance at university in the admissions process. Thus, this
study ﬁlls a research gap.
In this study, different admissions criteria were used as
input attributes to predict students’ ﬁrst-year CGPAs in the
computer sciences colleges of Saudi public universities.
Most of the few published related studies performed in
KSA have been conﬁned to medical colleges (e.g. [11]–[13],
[15]–[17]). These studies have not used EDM, which can
discover hidden patterns in institutions’ large datasets, and
therefore enhance their decision making. One of the very
few studies related to this topic that has been conﬁned to a
computer science college is study [18], which applied one
of the EDM techniques (i.e., J48 decision tree) to predict
students’ ﬁnal GPA based on their grades in all courses.
The authors of [18] collected data from the academic tran-
scripts of 236 students of the Computer Science College at
King Saud University (KSU) in KSA. They identiﬁed which
courses in the study plan most strongly affect ﬁnal GPA.
However, they applied only one EDM technique on a very
small dataset to predict student performance and did not
ensure the accuracy of their results by using additional EDM
techniques.
Another study that related to this topic in KSA is
study [25], which applied three EDM techniques (Naïve
Bayes, ANN, and Decision Tree) to predict student per-
formance based on their academic records and forum
participation. By comparing results of the three prediction
techniques, they found that Naïve Bayes outperformed others
by achieving a prediction accuracy rate of 86%.
However, the studies [18], [25] have not assessed the rela-
tionship between admission criteria and computer science
student performance in Saudi public universities, which is the
focus of this study.
To the best of our knowledge, the only related published
study that addressed this topic is study [14]. In this study, the
authors applied regression techniques on a dataset of 657 stu-
dents to determine whether pre-admission exams have a sig-
niﬁcant effect on student GPA. They found that high school
ﬁnal grade affects college GPA more than pre-admission
exam scores. These ﬁndings differ from the ﬁndings of this
study.
However, their data was collected from only one depart-
ment (the Information Technology department) of the Com-
puter Science College at KSU, which has ﬁve departments.
In addition, they only used one statistical process (i.e.,
Regression Analysis) rather than applying different EDM
models to predict student performance, which could have
enhanced their ﬁndings.
III. UNDERSTANDING THE DOMAIN OF THE STUDY
In KSA, enrollment in the computer science and technology
colleges of public universities has increased from 2,959 stu-
dents in academic year 2004-2005 to 27,089 students in
academic year 2016-2017 [26]. Since the early 2000s, all
Saudi public universities have central policies and procedures
for student admissions that are controlled by the Saudi Min-
istry of Education [27]. Before an applicant can be admit-
ted into any undergraduate program at any Saudi public
university computer science and technology college, he/she
is expected to take two standardized tests administrated
by the National Assessment Center for Higher Education.
These tests are the General Aptitude Test (GAT) and the
Scholastic Achievement Admission Test (SAAT). While the
GAT assesses mathematical and verbal skills to measure
students’ comprehension, logical reasoning, problem solving,
and inductive/deductive skills, the SAAT assesses compre-
hension, application, and inference in ﬁve subjects: biology,
chemistry, physics, mathematics, and English [28].
Admissions is based primarily on the weighted average
score of three criteria: the High School Grade Average
(HSGA), the SAAT, and the GAT. Each public university
assigns certain weights to these three criteria, and each pro-
gram identiﬁes a cut-off point for weighted averages based
on the number of available seats in each year. For example,
in academic year 2017-2018, the weights of these three cri-
teria in the four most famous Saudi public universities are,
for the three criteria (HSGA, SAAT, and GAT), respectively:
30%, 40%, and 30% at KSU [29]; 50%, 20%, and 30% at
King Abdulaziz University [30]; 20%, 50%, and 30% at King
Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals [31]; and 60%,
20%, and 20% at PNU [32].
However, it is difﬁcult to determine appropriate weights for
these criteria because of the lack of existing studies in KSA to
analyze the relationship between these criteria and the student
performance at university. This study will help in selecting
students through a more appropriate system of weights that
prioritizes the correct criteria.
IV. METHODOLOGY
1) To answer the ﬁrst question in this study (Is it possible to
identify the admission criterion that most accurately predicts
applicants’ future academic performance?), we developed
a model using the Linear Regression technique, which is
widely used for ﬁnding relationship between independent
variables (i.e., predictors) and a dependent variable (i.e.,
response). The model helped us to determine the relationship
between the three admission criteria (HSGA, SAAT, and
GAT) as the independent variables, and the CGPA through
students’ ﬁrst two semesters as the dependent variable. To
describe the strength the linear relationship between each
admission criteria and the CGPA, we used the correlation
coefﬁcient, which are usually used in statistics to measure the
strength and direction of the linear relationships between two
variables. In addition, to describe the percentage of the effect
of each admission criteria on the students’ ﬁrst-year CGPA,
we used the coefﬁcient of determination.
2) To answer the second question in this study (Is it possible
to predict applicants’ early academic performance before
admitting them based on their pre-admission test scores?),

Mengash - 2020 - Using Data Mining Techniques to Predict Student Performance to Support Decision Making in University.pdf,"H. A. Mengash: Using Data Mining Techniques to Predict Student Performance to Support Decision Making
we developed four prediction models by applying four well-
known data mining classiﬁcation techniques, namely: Artiﬁ-
cial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree, Support Vector
Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes.
There are multiple DM classiﬁcation techniques, however,
our choices in this paper are these four well-known ones
because of their critical features, which we brieﬂy describe
in the next paragraphs:
A. ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN)
ANN is a popular technique in EDM, and is designed to
mimic the structure of the human brain to solve complex
problems. It consists of a set of units that accept a weighted
set of inputs and responds with an output.
Many published papers have used ANN to predict students’
performance (e.g., [8], [21], [23], [24], [33]). We, also, used
it because of its ability to detect all possible interactions
among variables and its ability to learn from a limited set of
examples. In addition, ANN models were found in a previous
study to outperform classiﬁcation techniques in correctly
classifying admitted applicant who will accepted and not
accepted [33]. In this study, we used the Multilayer Percep-
tion (MLP) topology for the ANN model due to the nature
of the datasets, which were not large enough to require more
complex topologies.
B. DECISION TREE
Decision Tree is based on a set of nodes that are arranged
from the top to the bottom of the tree. Each node represents
a feature of an instance, and its branches represent possible
values. We used this technique because it is widely used by
researchers due to its simplicity (e.g., [1], [6], [7], [9], [34]).
It predicts values in a simple and straightforward way. In
addition, it has some advantages like represents rules that
could be understood and interpreted easily by users, perform
well for categorical and numerical attributes, and does not
require complex data preparation [6].
C. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)
This classiﬁcation technique builds a hyperplane that sepa-
rates objects based on their classes. The larger the distance
from the hyperplane to the nearest object becomes, the lower
the generalization error of the SVM technique becomes. SVM
is used in few researches (e.g., [7], [23], [24]) and is used in
this study because it is well suited for small datasets. Further,
it is faster than the other techniques [19].
D. NAIVE BAYES
Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic technique based
on applying Bayes’ theorem with independent assump-
tions between variables. It assigns probabilities to each
object for each possible class. In this study, we chose
to use this technique due to its simplicity, very good
performance for real-world problems, computational efﬁ-
ciency [35], and popularity in the related research literature
(e.g., [7], [23], [24], [35]–[37]).
3) To answer the third question in this paper (Which data
mining prediction technique performs best in this study?),
we evaluated and compared the performance of the four
models by using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Measure
metrics. (See Evaluation Metrics in Subsection A, Experi-
mental Setup at the following section)
4) To answer the fourth question in this study (Do stu-
dents admitted under the new weighting system achieve better
academic performance during their ﬁrst two semesters than
past students admitted under the old weighting system?),
we developed the second stage of the study to compare the
ﬁrst-year CGPAs of new students admitted for academic
year 2018-2019 under the new admission criteria weights to
the ﬁrst-year CGPAs of past students admitted for academic
years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 under the old admission
criteria weights.

A. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
1) DATASET
This study was conducted with the records of students
enrolled in the CCIS at PNU. The methods used, however, are
general and can be used in any higher education institution.
The data was obtained from the academic electronic database
of the ofﬁce of the Admitted and Registration Deanship. The
required ethical approval was obtained from the Institution
Review Board of PNU (Number 19-0152). PNU is the only
public female-only university in KSA and is also the largest
university for women in the world. The campus is 32 million
square feet and has approximately 50,000 students and more
than 5,000 academic and administrative staff. The CCIS was
established in 2007 to fulﬁll the growing need in KSA for
female higher education in the ﬁelds of computer science and
technology. CCIS has three departments: Computer Science,
Information Systems, and Information Technology. The pro-
grams of the three departments in CCIS are completed during
students’ four-year study plans. Each year is divided into two
semesters.
In the ﬁrst stage of this study, we collected a total of 1,569
student records from all three departments from two batches,
namely 902 students from academic year 2016-2017 and
667 students from academic year 2017-2018. All students
of this study were Saudi females, who live in the same
region (the central region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia).
In addition, all students do not work while in college, but
they all receive a monthly salary from the government. The
acceptance of the students from both batches was based pri-
marily on three admission criteria: HSGA, SAAT, and GAT,
for which the assigned weights were 60%, 20%, and 20%,
respectively.
Based on the results and recommendations provided by
the ﬁrst stage of this study, which shows that SAAT score
is the admission criterion that most accurately predicts stu-
dent performance, PNU decided to change the weighting
of its admission criteria. The weights were changed to the
VOLUME 8, 2020 55465","we developed four prediction models by applying four well-
known data mining classiﬁcation techniques, namely: Artiﬁ-
cial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree, Support Vector
Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes.
There are multiple DM classiﬁcation techniques, however,
our choices in this paper are these four well-known ones
because of their critical features, which we brieﬂy describe
in the next paragraphs:
A. ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN)
ANN is a popular technique in EDM, and is designed to
mimic the structure of the human brain to solve complex
problems. It consists of a set of units that accept a weighted
set of inputs and responds with an output.
Many published papers have used ANN to predict students’
performance. We, also, used
it because of its ability to detect all possible interactions
among variables and its ability to learn from a limited set of
examples. In addition, ANN models were found in a previous
study to outperform classiﬁcation techniques in correctly
classifying admitted applicant who will accepted and not
accepted. In this study, we used the Multilayer Percep-
tion (MLP) topology for the ANN model due to the nature
of the datasets, which were not large enough to require more
complex topologies.
B. DECISION TREE
Decision Tree is based on a set of nodes that are arranged
from the top to the bottom of the tree. Each node represents
a feature of an instance, and its branches represent possible
values. We used this technique because it is widely used by
researchers due to its simplicity.
It predicts values in a simple and straightforward way. In
addition, it has some advantages like represents rules that
could be understood and interpreted easily by users, perform
well for categorical and numerical attributes, and does not
require complex data preparation.
C. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)
This classiﬁcation technique builds a hyperplane that sepa-
rates objects based on their classes. The larger the distance
from the hyperplane to the nearest object becomes, the lower
the generalization error of the SVM technique becomes. SVM
is used in few researches and is used in
this study because it is well suited for small datasets. Further,
it is faster than the other techniques.
D. NAIVE BAYES
Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic technique based
on applying Bayes’ theorem with independent assump-
tions between variables. It assigns probabilities to each
object for each possible class. In this study, we chose
to use this technique due to its simplicity, very good
performance for real-world problems, computational efﬁ-
ciency, and popularity in the related research literature.

following for HSGA, SAAT, and GAT, respectively: 30%,
40%, and 30%.
In the second stage of this study, we collected a total of 470
student records from all three departments from academic
year 2018-2019, for which student acceptance was based on
the new assigned weights. Other students’ conditions were
similar to those mentioned in the ﬁrst stage of the study.
We used this data set to compare the ﬁrst-year CGPAs of new
students to the ﬁrst-year CGPAs of students admitted under
the old admission criteria weights.
All collected data sets were organized in Microsoft Excel,
and each student’s record included scores on the three admis-
sion criteria (all values between 0 and 100), and her CGPA
after her ﬁrst two semesters (all values between 0 and 5)
Data is then converted from the Excel ﬁle into the standard
format required by the Waikato Environment for Knowledge
Analysis (WEKA) tool [38], which we used in this study for
the Data Mining techniques. WEKA is an open source tool
coded in Java, and we selected it because it is widely used in
EDM research.
For the ﬁrst stage of the study and before applying
the EDM techniques, we prepared the data set with pre-
processing. We took steps such as eliminating certain
irrelevant attributes (e.g., student ID, name, and address),
identifying outliers, deleting records with missing val-
ues, and removing duplicates. The total remaining number
of student records after the previous data pre-processing
was 1,430 records for 828 students from academic year
2016-2017 and 602 students from academic year 2017-2018.
Fig. 1 shows mean values for HSGA, SAAT, and GAT.
We constructed a categorical target variable (class) based
on the original numeric parameter CGPA. It has ﬁve cate-
gories according to the ﬁve-level scale that is used in PNU
grade system, which based on the following ranges: excellent
(≥4.5), very good (3.75 to < 4.5), good (2.75 to < 3.75),
average (2.0 to < 2.75), and poor ( <2.0). The CGPA distri-
bution for students enrolled in academic year 2016-2017 and
academic year 2017-2018 is shown in Fig. 2.
FIGURE 2. Students’ first-year CGPA distribution for academic year

We also applied pre-processing to the data set of academic
year 2018-2019 through some data pre-processing as we
did to the data sets for academic years 2016 to 2018. The
total number of remaining student records for academic year
2018-2019 was 437.
We developed four prediction models by applying four
well-known data mining classiﬁcation techniques, namely:
Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree, Support
Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes. Each model was
built using 10-fold cross validation, in which 9 sets of data
were used for training the model and the remaining set was
used for testing purposes. The process was repeated 10 times,
ones for each of the different sets. This process maximized the
total number of observation used for testing. All models were
run using the parameter values deﬁned by default in WEKA
software.
2) EVALUATION METRICS
The performance of the data mining models can be deter-
mined by using the following concepts:
• True Positive Rate (TP): the number of instances that are
correctly predicted as positive.
• False Positive Rate (FP): the number of instances that
are incorrectly predicted as positive.
• True Negative Rate (TN): the number of instances that
are correctly predicted as negative.
• False Negative Rate (FN): the number of instances that
are incorrectly predicted as negative.
Accuracy is the percentage of correctly predicted results and
is measured with (1):
Accuracy =(TP +TN)/(TP +TN +FP +FN) (1)
Recall is the percentage of positives that are correctly pre-
dicted as positive and is measured with (2):
Recall =TP/(TP +FN) (2)
Precision is the percentage of correct positive observations
and is measured with (3):
Precision =TP/(TP +FP) (3)

B. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
1) MOST SIGNIFICANT CRITERION IDENTIFICATION
The results of this study showed that students’ ﬁrst-year
CGPAs could be predicted based on admission criteria,
which underscores their importance as signiﬁcant predictors
of student performance in Saudi higher education institu-
tions. To identify the admission criterion that most accu-
rately predicts student academic performance at university,
we used the result of the correlation coefﬁcient between the
variables, as demonstrated in Table 1, and the coefﬁcient
of determination between the variables, as demonstrated in
Table 2.
Analysis of Table 1 shows that SAAT scores have the
strongest correlation with ﬁrst-year CGPAs at the value
of 44% of all other independent variables.
In addition, the percent impact of SAAT score on stu-
dent ﬁrst-year CGPA is 19%, which is the highest per-
cent impact among the admission variables, as shown in
Table 2.
Therefore, SAAT score is the admission criterion that most
accurately predicts later academic performance at univer-
sity. More weight should therefore be assigned to it. This
result matches those of other national studies conducted in
KSA (e.g., [11], [12], [15], [16]), which also show that
SAAT score is the most signiﬁcant positive predictor of
student performance in Saudi medical schools. However,
our result contradicts what is proposed in another national
study [14], which found that the HSGA affects student CGPA
more than the other two criteria. This difference could be
attributed to many factors, such as the fact that HSGA score
represents attainment in all high school subjects including
those that are not related to computer science. In addition,

2) CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUE PERFORMANCE
After implementing the four mentioned classifying tech-
niques, their performance is shown in Table 3.
Comparison of the classiﬁer performance among all the
applied classiﬁers is demonstrated in Fig. 3.
Analysis of Table 3 shows that it is possible to predict
applicants’ early academic performance at university before
admitting them based on their admission criteria. Accuracy,
recall, precision, and F1-Measure are high when applying
each classiﬁer technique. Therefore, the institution in charge
may adopt these techniques to predict students’ academic
performance before accepting them.
As shown in Fig. 3, the ANN classiﬁer technique out-
performs the other techniques in both explored performance
metrics: the accuracy rate (79%), which represents classiﬁer
effectiveness, and the precision rate (81%), which represents
classiﬁer predictive power. This result corroborates the result
in other studies [8, 24]. In addition, the DT classiﬁer tech-
nique outperforms the others in the recall rate (80%), which
represents classiﬁer sensitivity, and in the F1-Measure rate
(81%), which conveys the balance between the recall and
the precision. This result matches the results of other studies
(e.g., [7], [35], [39]).
Further, the SVM classiﬁer technique shows accurate pre-
dictions. As in other studies (e.g., [36], [37]), the NB clas-
siﬁer technique performs worse than the other techniques,

According to these results, we may conclude that, in this
particular setting, the ANN classiﬁer technique generally
outperforms the other techniques. The superiority of the ANN
technique in predicting student performance has been widely
discussed in the literature (e.g., [19], [24], [40]).
3) STUDENT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
Based on the results and recommendations provided by this
study, the PNU Admitted and Registration Deanship decided
that the current admissions system should be changed to
modify the weights of admission criteria to ensure high per-
formance of ﬁrst-year students. The deanship decided to add
more weight to the SAAT criterion and change the weights
of the three admission criteria (HSGA, SAAT, and GAT)
to be 30%, 40%, and 30%, respectively, for academic year
2018-2019. The previous corresponding weights were 60%,
20%, 20%, respectively.
Fig. 4 shows the comparisons between the new students’
ﬁrst-year CGPAs to ﬁrst-year CGPAs for students from pre-
vious years.
As shown in Fig. 4, after adding more weight to the most
signiﬁcant admission criterion (SAAT score), the percentage
of students who achieved an excellent or very good ﬁrst-
year academic performance increased from 34% in academic
year 2016-2018 to 65% in academic year 2018-2019. In addi-
tion, the percentage of the students who achieved an accept-
able or poor ﬁrst-year academic performance decreased
from 24% in academic year 2016-2018 to 6% in academic
year 2018-2019. This result corroborates the recommen-
dation of this study to assign more weight to the admis-
sion criterion that most accurately predicts future student
performance.
VI. CONCLUSION
The aim of this study is to support higher education insti-
tutions in making good decisions in its admissions pro-
cess by predicting applicants’ academic performance before
admitting them. Four prediction models were proposed and
developed using four well-known data mining techniques,
namely: Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree,
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes. The study
was conducted with a dataset of 2,039 records of students
enrolled in PNU, one of the largest universities in KSA. The
methods used, however, are general and can be used in any
higher education institution.
The study conﬁrms the effectiveness of prediction mod-
eling in higher education institutions where decision makers
can use these models in planning and optimizing institutions’
limited resource allocations.
In addition, the results show that a high performance model
to predict students’ early performance could be developed
based on pre-admission information. For example, in this par-
ticular study, the ANN model was able to reach performance
accuracy levels of about 79.22%.
Moreover, the results of this study show that ANN tech-
nique outperforms the others in both accuracy and precision
metrics, while the Decision Tree technique outperforms the
others in recall and F1-Measure. The Naive Bayes had the
worst results.
This study concludes that SAAT score is the admission
criterion that most accurately predicts later academic perfor-
mance and that more weight should therefore be assigned
to it. Based on this recommendation, decision makers at PNU,
where this study was conducted, reviewed the admissions
system and decided to modify the weights of their three
admission criteria mentioned in this study by assigning more
weight to SAAT score.
To investigate how the new admission process impacts
student performance at PNU, this study compares the ﬁrst-
year CGPAs of students admitted using the old admissions
weighting system to the ﬁrst-year CGPAs of students admit-
ted under the old weighting system. The results show that,
after applying the new admission weighting system, the per-
centage of students who achieved excellent or very good ﬁrst-
year CGPAs increased by 31%, and the percentage of the
students who achieved acceptable or poor ﬁrst-year CGPAs
decreased by 18%.
A. RECOMMENDATIONS
• Decision makers in Saudi computer science colleges
should give serious consideration to students’ pre-
admission SAAT scores before accepting them.
• Other important pre-admission exams, which measure
English-language proﬁciency should be added to the
admission process for engineering and computer science
colleges, because all courses in these colleges are con-
ducted in English.
• Higher education institutions should consider more pre-
admission variables that may affect future student per-
formance such as parent education, previous high school
(national or international), social interaction network,
and programming knowledge.
• By applying data mining techniques, institutions can
identify students in risk situations very early, which

year 2018-2019. This result corroborates the recommen-
dation of this study to assign more weight to the admis-
sion criterion that most accurately predicts future student
performance.
VI. CONCLUSION
The aim of this study is to support higher education insti-
tutions in making good decisions in its admissions pro-
cess by predicting applicants’ academic performance before
admitting them. Four prediction models were proposed and
developed using four well-known data mining techniques,
namely: Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree,
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes. The study
was conducted with a dataset of 2,039 records of students
enrolled in PNU, one of the largest universities in KSA. The
methods used, however, are general and can be used in any
higher education institution.
The study conﬁrms the effectiveness of prediction mod-
eling in higher education institutions where decision makers
can use these models in planning and optimizing institutions’
limited resource allocations.
In addition, the results show that a high performance model
to predict students’ early performance could be developed
based on pre-admission information. For example, in this par-
ticular study, the ANN model was able to reach performance
accuracy levels of about 79.22%.
Moreover, the results of this study show that ANN tech-
nique outperforms the others in both accuracy and precision
metrics, while the Decision Tree technique outperforms the
others in recall and F1-Measure. The Naive Bayes had the
worst results.
This study concludes that SAAT score is the admission
criterion that most accurately predicts later academic perfor-
mance and that more weight should therefore be assigned
to it. Based on this recommendation, decision makers at PNU,
where this study was conducted, reviewed the admissions
system and decided to modify the weights of their three
admission criteria mentioned in this study by assigning more
weight to SAAT score.
To investigate how the new admission process impacts
student performance at PNU, this study compares the ﬁrst-
year CGPAs of students admitted using the old admissions
weighting system to the ﬁrst-year CGPAs of students admit-
ted under the old weighting system. The results show that,
after applying the new admission weighting system, the per-
centage of students who achieved excellent or very good ﬁrst-
year CGPAs increased by 31%, and the percentage of the
students who achieved acceptable or poor ﬁrst-year CGPAs
decreased by 18%.
A. RECOMMENDATIONS
• Decision makers in Saudi computer science colleges
should give serious consideration to students’ pre-
admission SAAT scores before accepting them.
• Other important pre-admission exams, which measure
English-language proﬁciency should be added to the
admission process for engineering and computer science
colleges, because all courses in these colleges are con-
ducted in English.
• Higher education institutions should consider more pre-
admission variables that may affect future student per-
formance such as parent education, previous high school
(national or international), social interaction network,
and programming knowledge.
• By applying data mining techniques, institutions can
identify students in risk situations very early, which"

will help decision makers to give them more attention
and to build a strategic plan to improve their academic
performance.
B. FUTURE STUDY
All classiﬁcation techniques were applied on data collected
from a single university in Saudi Arabia. Thus, to validate
these ﬁndings further, more studies should use data from mul-
tiple Saudi universities, as well as American and European
universities. In addition, further studies are needed to con-
sider more pre-admission factors that affect future student
performance, such as student personality, student demogra-
phy, student family, and communication skills. For future
study, other data mining techniques such as clustering may
be used.
