ABSTRACT 
Blended learning combines on line digital resources with traditional classroom activities and enables 
students to attain higher learning performance through well -defined interactive strategies involving online 
and traditional learning activities. Learning analytics is a conceptual fra mework and as a part of our 
Precision education used to analyze and predict students’ performance and provide timely interventions 
based on student learning profiles. This study applied learning analytics and educational big data 
approaches for the early p rediction of students’ final academic performance in a blended Calculus course. 
Real data with 21 variables were collected from the proposed course, consisting of video -viewing 
behaviors, out-of-class practice behaviors, homework and quiz scores, and after -school tutoring. This study 
applied principal component regression to predict students’ final academic performance. The experimental 
results show that students’ final academic performance could be predicted when only one -third of the 
semester had elapsed.  In addition, we identified seven critical factors that affect students’ academic 
performance, consisting of four online factors and three traditional factors. The results showed that the 
blended data set combining online and traditional critical factors had the highest predictive performance.

Introduction 
 
Blended learning, also known as hybrid learning or mixed -mode instruction, incorporates one or two learning 
strategies into traditional classroom teaching. In 1960, many computer programming courses relied on the 
Internet to deliver digital learning materials to students; for example, Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching 
Operations, developed at the University of Illinois  (Hart, 1995 ), provided teaching activities that could be 
conducted on a large scale to enable a single instructor to simultaneously teach a large number of students.  
 
In recent years, blended learning has become a popular teaching strategy because of the dev elopment of data 
analysis and computation; for example, Ellis, Pardo, and Han (2016 ) integrated social networking into a one -
semester course and monitored the behaviors of over 220 undergraduate engineering students. The researchers 
used the students’ interactive records to examine how to help them succeed in a collaboratively driven cour se. 
Hong et al. (2016 ) adopted a web game to develop ten teaching scenarios. After 6 weeks  of experimentation on 
110 elementary school students, the researchers indicated that the students were highly motivated by the 
combination of game -based learning and traditional classroom activities. Huang, Yang, Chiang, and Su (2016 ) 
improved students’ learning motivations and performance in an English course by incorporating  a mobile-based 
vocabulary feedback application into a traditional classroom environment. 
 
To gain benefits from blended learning, many educators have adopted the Online Assessment System (OAS) or 
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) into their course design; for example, Awang and Zakaria (2013 ) 
integrated the OAS into an integral course for 101 college students. The results indicated that the OAS improved 
the students’ learning performance. Lu, Huang, Huang, and Yang (2017) incorporated MOOCs into a course and 
the results showed evidence of a well -defined intervention strategy. The course not only facilitated the students’ 
learning achievements but also increased their level  of engagement. Although the aforementioned studies have 
explained the advantages of blended learning, many researchers have asserted that in blended courses, 
monitoring students’ learning behaviors and habits is difficult because of the complex learning e nvironment 
(Ellis et al., 2016 ; Hong et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, at-risk students cannot be identified, and 
thus timely interventions cannot be conducted to facilitate learning success (Tempelaar, Rienties, & Giesbers, 
2015).","ABSTRACT

To help students achieve classroom success, educators in Europe and the United States have recently applied 
learning analytics. In 2011, Horizon Report, a report of educational trends, investigated the benefit s and future 
trends of learning analytics (Johnson, Smith, Willis, Levine, & Haywood, 2011 ). The report defined learning 
analytics as an ideal framework to improve learning performance based on data of students’ learning history. 
Because of the limitations of data analysis and computation, learning analytics has been considered as a 
conceptual framework since 2011. Because of the rise of big data technology, in 2016, a special issue of Horizon 
Report was released on learning analytics to highlight that the optimal time to incorporate learning analytics into 
classroom settings had arrived (Johnson et al., 2016). 
 
In recent years, learning analytics has served as a conceptual framework for the analysis of cou rse 
characteristics, and has included prediction of students’ learning performance, educational data analysis process 
development (Hwang, Chu, & Yin, 2017 ), data collection, and timely intervention (Hwang, 2014). To develop a 
conceptual framework for learning analysis, many researchers have designed and implemented courses with 
strategies for learning analytics. Lu et al. (2017) measured student engagement in a virtual learning environment 
and intervened with the students’ learning activities according to the engagement score. The results showed 
improvements in the students’ final academic performance and their self -regulated abi lities after applying 
learning analytics. Hachey, Wladis, and Conway (2014 ) collected the learning data of 962 students to de termine 
the factors that influence their grade point averages (GPAs). The results showed that students with no experience 
of online learning obtained low retention rates and had low GPA scores. The researchers concluded that online 
learning and practice mu st be offered to students without relevant experience before the beginning of a course 
(Papamitsiou & Economides, 2014). 
 
In our research, learning analytics is a conceptual framework and as a part o f our Precision education used to 
analyze and predict students’ performance and provide timely interventions based on student learning profiles. 
The idea of our Precision education is the same as of The Precision Medicine Initiative (see 
https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/node/333101), which was proposed by President Obama in his 2015 State 
of the Union address, the Initiative is a new research effort to revolutionize the medical treatment of disease. As 
addressed in this Initiative, most treatments were designed for the average patients as a result of one -size-fits-all-
approach treatments which could be successful for some patients but not for others. With the same philosophy, 
we carry the idea of Precision medicine, which is to improve the diagnosis, pre diction, treatment, and prevention 
of disease, and define the objective of our Precision education as the improvement of diagnosis, prediction, 
treatment, and prevention of learning outcome. 
 
The previous studies have shown that the development of big data  technology has enabled learning analytics to

quantities of learning data can be collected through learning management system (LMS) to enrich personal  
learning data. However, few case studies have been conducted on the effects of applying learning analytics in 
blended courses due to the complexity of learning environments and the diversity of data. To provide timely 
interventions for at -risk students th rough learning analytics in blended learning, the present study not only 
implemented a MOOC and OAS enabled Calculus course but also proposed a process for the early identification 
of at-risk students. To predict students’ final academic performance, many studies have used only one data set: a 
subset of a blended course. To improve prediction performance, critical factors may need to be identified and 
prediction accuracy may need to be compared using a data set combining online and traditional learning 
activities. The following research questions were proposed: 
RQ1. How early can we predict students’ final academic performance?  
RQ2. Which are the most critical factors that affect students’ final academic performance in blended learning?  
RQ3. Which type of data set (blended vs. online vs. traditional) is more effective for predicting students’ final

According to the learning analytics executive reports by Arroway, Morgan, O’Keefe, and Yanosky (2015 ) and 
Kuzilek, Hlosta, Herrmannova, Zdrahal, and Wolff (2015), the first stage of implementing learning analytics is to 
identify at-risk students. Moreover, at -risk student identification must be conducted as early as  possible to allow 
sufficient time for instructors to conduct educational interventions to facilitate students’ learning achievements. 
Early at -risk student identification originated from the implementation of an open course that yielded a high 
dropout rate (Yang, Huang, & Huang, 2017).","To help students achieve classroom success, educators in Europe and the United States have recently applied

Many researchers have defined dropout as a risk of MOOCs and have designed prediction methods to identify 
the dropout group. Xing, Chen, Stein, and Marcinkowski (2016 ) collected data on 3,617 students’ video 
watching behaviors in 2014 and developed a classification model to identify the students likely to drop out by 
the following week. The results suggested that the retention rate would have been higher if the instruct ors had 
conducted timely interventions based on the prediction results. Lara, Lizcano, Martínez, Pazos, and Riera (2014 ) 
collected historical data on 100 students in a virtual learning environment consisting of five variables and 
proposed a knowledge discovery system for dividing students into dropout and non -dropout groups. The 
researchers reached a 90% classification accuracy through a verification process involving 100 students. 
Thammasiri, Dele n, Meesad, and Kasap (2014 ) compared several resample algorithms with 7 years of student 
interaction data to assess data imbalance. Moreover, the target data was 80% true, indicating that 80% of 
freshman continued their studies, and 20% as false, indica ting that 20% dropped out. These results show that the 
combination of synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) and the support vector machine yielded a 
classification accuracy of 90%, which was an improvement on the 86% accuracy without resampling in 10 -
folder cross validation. In addition to online courses, numerous researchers have incorporated student learning 
performance prediction into traditional classroom settings. Hachey et al. (2014 ) used a unique combination of 
variables to construct several classification models and verified the models with historical data collected from a 
learning management system. The results indicated that if th e goal is to predict the learning outcomes of students 
with online course experience, retention rate is a more useful variable than GPA. For all other goals, GPA is 
more favorable. The results of the aforementioned studies show that at -risk students can be  identified through 
classification methods if at -risk is defined as potential course dropout. However, in contrast to some studies, 
which have used data from open courses and pure online courses, another group of researchers defined at -risk as 
students who  failed or obtained low grades at the end of a course. Many researchers have since adopted this 
approach for predicting students’ final academic performance. 
 
 
Students’ final academic performance prediction 
 
To identify at-risk students based on their final grades, scores, or learning outcomes, educational data mining can 
be used to identify students’ behavioral patterns and predict their grades (Romero & Ventura, 2010 ). Romero, 
López, Luna, and Ventura (2013 ) collected data on 114 students from an online discussion forum and sep arated 
them into several data subsets on a weekly basis before evaluating each data set’s predictive accuracy through 
several data -mining methods. Romero et al. (2013 ) used the sequentia l minimal optimization classification 
algorithm and student interaction data before a midterm exam to achieve the highest accuracy for predicting 
student learning performance. Hu, Lo, and Shih (2014 ) developed an early warning system by using a decision 
tree classifier. The model was constructed from data on 300 students and contained 13 online variables, 
including for how long each student had used the system and how many documents had been read by e ach 
student in the preceding week. The results revealed a 95% accuracy in predicting whether students would pass or 
fail based on 1 –4 weeks of data from a skewed data set. To verify which critical factors affect prediction 
performance, Villagrá -Arnedo, Gallego -Durán, Compañ, Llorens -Largo, and Molina -Carmona (2016 ) 
determined 8 variables for student behavior and 53 for learning activity from a learning management system. 
Villagrá-Arnedo et al. (2016 ) designed four experiments to validate a data set with different variable 
combinations. The results demonstrated  that a data set with particular variables had the highest correlation 
coefficient with grades and could attain higher prediction accuracy than the others. 
 
In addition to predicting student learning outcomes, one study used students’ grades as prediction labels and 
marked students as at -risk if their prediction grades were below average. Meier, Xu, Atan, and van der Schaar 
(2016) used regression to design a neighbourhood selection process to predict students’ grade s. The researchers 
claimed that the proposed algorithm achieved 76% accuracy. Asif, Merceron, and Pathan (2014 ) used a naive 
Bayes classifier to demonstrate th at students’ grades in their final year of university could be predicted based on 
student data collected during freshman year. In addition, the researchers executed the feature selection process 
before classification and the results showed that the data se t from which socioeconomic and demographic 
variables had been removed was reasonably accurate. Huang and Fang (2013 ) used students’ final grades as 
prediction targets. To evaluate the prediction results, the researchers des igned two quantitative indicators to 
transfer the regression mean square error into prediction accuracy. The final results showed that the students’ 
final exam scores were predictable to 88% accuracy based on eight variables collected from a learning 
management system. Previous studies have explained that “at -risk” can generally be used to describe students 
who dropout, fail, or achieve low grades on courses. We can fulfil the critical requirement of learning analytics 
by using students’ final grades or scores as prediction indicators and designing a data -mining methodology based 
on classification or regression for the early prediction of indicators.","Many researchers have defined dropout as a risk of MOOCs and have designed prediction methods to identify

Recent studies have used data collected from entire course periods, which is problematic because, through th is 
method, students can only be determined as at -risk after the conclusion of a course, which is ineffective in real 
scenarios. Moreover, recent studies have used single data sets collected from virtual learning environments or 
classroom activities, which is ineffective for applying the results to blended courses that combine online and 
face-to-face learning. Therefore, we referred to recent studies to define the following four aspects for 
consideration: First, data must be divided into sub data sets based on duration (Hu et al., 2014 ; Romero et al., 
2013). Second, critical factors must be identified to improve prediction accuracy (Asif et al., 2014 ; Villagrá-
Arnedo et al., 2016 ); for example, Villagrá-Arnedo et al. (2016 ) reduced the number of variables f rom 61 to 23 
without losing prediction accuracy. Third, a predesigned regression model used in previous studies called 
principle component regression (PCR) (Agudo-Peregrina, Iglesias -Pradas, Conde -González, & Hernández -
García, 2014; Çevik, 2015; Huang & Fang, 2013; Meier et al., 2016) was used. The model was also implemented 
and evaluated in our previous study. PCR involves performing principle component analysis (PCA) to calculate 
the principle components, some of which can be used as variables in multiple linear regression. Fourth, design 
indicators and acceptanc e criteria must be considered to evaluate prediction performance. Although the 
regression model provided several indicators to evaluate performance, it did not provide any accuracy indicator. 
Therefore, following the concept of prediction accuracy proposed  by Huang and Fang (2013 ), we applied the 
cross-validation mechanism proposed by Golub, Heath, and Wahba (1979 ) to design indicators to evaluate 
prediction performance. Moreover, in recent studies, the acceptance of p rediction accuracy ranged from 75% 
(Villagrá-Arnedo et al., 2016) to 95% (Hu et al., 2014).

The Calculus course lasted for 18 weeks and included six learning activities ( Figure 1). During the course, the 
participants used MOOCs to preview Calculus content through Open edX  (see https://open.edx.org/about-open-
edx) and practiced Calculus by using the OAS through Maple T .A. (see http://www.maplesoft.com/). To improve","Recent studies have used data collected from entire course periods, which is problematic because, through th is 
method, students can only be determined as at -risk after the conclusion of a course, which is ineffective in real 
scenarios. Moreover, recent studies have used single data sets collected from virtual learning environments or 
classroom activities, which is ineffective for applying the results to blended courses that combine online and 
face-to-face learning. Therefore, we referred to recent studies to define the following four aspects for 
consideration: First, data must be divided into sub data sets based on duration. Second, critical factors must be identified to improve prediction accuracy; for example, Villagrá-Arnedo et al. (2016 ) reduced the number of variables f rom 61 to 23 
without losing prediction accuracy. Third, a predesigned regression model used in previous studies called 
principle component regression (PCR) was used. The model was also implemented 
and evaluated in our previous study. PCR involves performing principle component analysis (PCA) to calculate 
the principle components, some of which can be used as variables in multiple linear regression. Fourth, design 
indicators and acceptanc e criteria must be considered to evaluate prediction performance. Although the 
regression model provided several indicators to evaluate performance, it did not provide any accuracy indicator. 
Therefore, following the concept of prediction accuracy proposed  by Huang and Fang (2013 ), we applied the 
cross-validation mechanism proposed by Golub, Heath, and Wahba (1979 ) to design indicators to evaluate 
prediction performance. Moreover, in recent studies, the acceptance of p rediction accuracy ranged from 75% 
(Villagrá-Arnedo et al., 2016) to 95% (Hu et al., 2014).

Process for predicting students’ final academic performance 
 
At-risk students can be identified as those with a predicted final academic perform ance of lower than 60. In the 
blended Calculus course, we applied a final academic performance prediction process with PCR consisting of 
data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation phases. The data preprocessing phase consisted of data integration 
and dat a set separation. Data integration focused on integrating the learning data derived from MOOCs, the 
OAS, homework, quiz scores, and after -school tutoring. This study defined 21 variables from the blended 
learning environments consisting of data of online a nd traditional learning. The details of variables are described 
in Table 3. In the data set separation, the duration of the collected learning data wa s identified. The details of the 
proposed accumulated and duration data sets are described in the following section. In the modeling phase, a 
prediction model for students’ final academic performance was generated through PCR. The evaluation phase 
was focu sed on measuring the goodness of fit and predictive effectiveness of the regression model. In the 
evaluation phase, this study measured not only the goodness of fit of the regression model by using the mean 
squared error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and Quantile–Quantile (Q–Q) plot but also the predictive 
performance of the regression model by using the predictive MSE (pMSE) and predictive mean absolute 
percentage correction (pMAPC), both of which were proposed in our previous study.","participants’ mathematics ability, an instructor provided weekly after -school tutoring for each participant. To

set. Table 5 lists the average values and scale of the R2, adjusted R2, and Durbin -Watson statistic for each data

those of previous studies (Agudo-Peregrina et al., 2014 ; Çevik, 2015 ), which indicates that the explanatory

the mean range of the pMAPC among the accumulated and duration data sets was 0.82 -0.83. Regarding the

Linear regression residual analysis 
 
According to the results of conventional regression and predictive performance estimation presented in the 
previous section, the accumulated data set 
  had the highest stability and accuracy for predicting students’ final 
academic performance. A final test was required to  identify the characteristics of normalization, independence, 
and homogeneity in the data set. However, because PCA can project data into a vector space with a dimension 
with the same number of variables, 21 models were estimated for each data set. To foll ow up 
 , we had to 
select the most predictable components from the 21 PCR results.

and pMAPC values (178.94 and 83.5%, respectively) can be obtained in the 12 component s. Figure 4 shows the 
results of linear regression residual analysis by using a Q –Q plot of 12 principle components of

distribution for all residuals closely resembles a straight line, which indicates that the distribution for the 
difference between the predicted and real values supports the characteristics of normalization, independence, and 
homogeneity.

Determining critical factors that affect students’ final academic performance in blended learning  
 
According to the summary of the literature review, the first step to predicting students’ final academic 
performance is to determine as many variables  as possible. Subsequently, rules should be applied to enable the 
selection of variables to ob tain higher predicti on ability.  Moreover, according to the summary in previous 
section, data set 
  had the highest stability and predictive accuracy, and thus we used this data set to determine 
the critical factors that affect students’ learning performance. Table 8 shows the regression model estimation 
results. Components 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 12 had a significant influence on students’ final academic performance. 
For each significant component, we selected variables with higher coefficients as critical factors; fo r example, 
variable X2 was selected as the critical factor for Component 1 because of the substantial differences between the 
coefficient of variable X2 and those of the other variables.

Ability of different data sets  (blended vs. online vs. traditional) to predict students’ final academic

that the selected critical factors are crucial for predicting students’ final academic performance. In addition, the 
numbers of best components for the online, tradition al, and blended data sets were all equal to the numbers of 
independent variables for each data set, which shows that each data set required whole independent variables to 
determine the optimal predictive performance. The blended data set 
  obtained the optimal pMSE and

Conclusion 
 
This study collected student profiles from a MOOC and OAS enabled blended Calculus course. In addition, we 
applied PCR to evaluate five data sets that were separated based on the collected data. The experimental results 
demonstrate that students’ final academic performance in a blended Calculus cours e can be predicted with high 
stability and accuracy by a data set containing data from weeks 1 -6 of the course. In other words, through well -
identified online and traditional variables, we were able to predict students’ final academic performance when as 
early as one -third of the way through the semester. Seven critical factors that influence students’ learning 
performance were identified by the regression model to improve prediction performance. However, explaining 
the relationship between these critical f actors and learning performance would require investigation through 
interviews with educational experts. Furthermore, to achieve the goal of improving students’ learning 
performance, the student performance prediction model proposed in this study and a wel l-defined intervention 
strategy must be integrated into the learning analytics framework. The complete learning analytics framework 
could be applied to predict student learning outcomes in the second semester of such a Calculus course.

This study collected student profiles from a MOOC and OAS enabled blended Calculus course. In addition, we 
applied PCR to evaluate five data sets that were separated based on the collected data. The experimental results 
demonstrate that students’ final academic performance in a blended Calculus cours e can be predicted with high 
stability and accuracy by a data set containing data from weeks 1 -6 of the course. In other words, through well -
identified online and traditional variables, we were able to predict students’ final academic performance when as 
early as one -third of the way through the semester. Seven critical factors that influence students’ learning 
performance were identified by the regression model to improve prediction performance. However, explaining 
the relationship between these critical f actors and learning performance would require investigation through 
interviews with educational experts. Furthermore, to achieve the goal of improving students’ learning 
performance, the student performance prediction model proposed in this study and a wel l-defined intervention 
strategy must be integrated into the learning analytics framework. The complete learning analytics framework 
could be applied to predict student learning outcomes in the second semester of such a Calculus course.
