ABSTRACT 
The past decade has seen the rapid adopti on and use of various Learning Management 
Systems (LMS) in Africa, and Tanzania in pa rticular. Institutions have been spending 
thousands of dollars to implement these systems in a bid to improve the quality of education 
as well as increasing students’ enrolments through distance and ble nded learning. However, 
the impact of these system on improving studen ts’ performance has been a popular subject of 
research in recent years. Studies have been  relying on data from users’ opinions and 
subjective interpretation through  surveys to determine the e ffectiveness of LMS usage on 
students’ learning performance. The use of such data is normally subject to the possibility of 
distortion or low reliability. Therefore, this study designed and developed Learning Analytics 
tool and used the tool to determine th e causation between LMS usage and students’ 
performance. Data from LMS log of two course s delivered at Mbeya University of Science 
and Technology (MUST) were extracted using deve loped Learning Analytics tool and 
subjected into linear regression analysis with students’ fina l results. The study found that 
discussion posts, peer interaction, and exercises were determined to be significant factors for 
students’ academic achievement in blended le arning at MUST. Nonetheless, time spend in 
the LMS, number of downloads, and login frequency were found to have no significant 
impact on students’ learning performance. The implications of these results on improving 
students’ learning are discussed.

The past decade has seen the rapid adopti on and use of various Learning Management 
Systems (LMS) in higher education in Africa. The LMS are web-based systems that facilitate 
teaching and learning via the Internet with tools that provide interaction between students and 
their instructors. They also have tools that a llow instructors to share learning resources with 
students. Some of the popular LMS in the market are LMS include Sakai, Moodle, and 
Atutor, and Chisimba (Unwin et al., 2010). 
Many institutions tend to adopt  and use these systems to improve the quality of on-
campus delivery by complementing traditional face-to-face with LMS (Ssekakubo et al., 
2011; Unwin et al., 2010). Other institutions use these systems to meet the growing students’ 
population through distance and blended lear ning (Unwin et al., 2010). Given these 
advantages, the number of LMS that has been adopted by institutions in Africa, and Tanzania 
in particular has been increasing. 
As of 2011, almost 80% of institutions ha d installed LMS with Modular Object-
Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment (Mood le) being the most popular (Munguatosha et 
al., 2011). It was also revealed that  half of 11 surveyed institutions had installed various 
LMS (Mtebe & Raisamo, 2014). This is also evident from data obtained from Moodle","USING LEARNING ANALYTICS TO PREDICT STUDENTS’ PERFORMANCE IN

website that showed 47 Moodle sites were of institutions from Tanzania (Moodle LMS sites, 
2015). 
Despite the continued adoption and use of  various LMS throughout higher education, 
there is little eviden ce to suggest that they are ac tually improving students’ learning 
performance (Phillips et al., 2011). Apparently, many studies have used data from users’ 
perceptions and subjective inte rpretation through surveys to investigate the effectiveness of 
these system in Africa (e.g. Lwoga, 2012, 2014; Ssekakubo et al., 2011; Unwin et al., 2010). 
Nonetheless, the use of such data is normally subject to the possibility  of distortion or low 
reliability (Jo et al., 2014). Moreover, data obtained from students’ perceptions through 
surveys may not provide accurate indicators of l earning as they rarely  indicate the causality 
of effects (Phillips et al., 2011). 
Ultimately this points to the need for more  sophisticated methods of evaluating the 
effectiveness of LMS that is non-intrusive an d requires no instructor s’ intervention. New 
analytical methodologies, particularly Lear ning Analytics, have made fulfilling this 
requirement possible. Since most of learners  activities take place in the LMS, Learning 
Analytics tools can potentially utilize log data to provide crucial information on how learning 
processes occur throughout the login duration (Jo et al., 2014). Consequently, they can 
provide institutions informed decisions about possible problems related to students’ learning 
(Kotsiantis et al., 2013; Phillips et al., 2011). Compared with s ubjective methods such as 
surveys and questionnaires, Learning Analytics can capture learners’ authentic interactions in 
real time. 
Despite these great potential benefits of Learning Analytics, there has been no reliable 
evidence to suggest that institutions in Tanzania  have been utilizing them in a bid to improve 
students’ performance. Although some LMS have students tracking capabilities, the majority 
of them are generic and they do  not provide the depth of extr action and aggregation that is 
required for various contexts (Ferguson, 2012) . To address this, this study developed 
Learning Analytics tool that enables instruct ors to examine students’ activities in Moodle 
through utilizing data from the system log. 
The developed Learning Analytics tool wa s used to analyze data from the Moodle 
LMS at Mbeya University of Science and Technology (MUST) with 2 courses Applied 
Biology I and Services and Installation II. Th e courses were offered to 171 students via 
blended mode in the academic year 2014/2015. This tool will enable them to track how 
learners use the systems in order to find strate gies that will ensure that learners use these 
LMS features more effectively. The study had the following objectives: 
 
i) To establish requirements of designing a nd developing Learning an alytic tool based 
on strength and weakness of analyze existing Learning analytic tools.  
ii) To design and implement the LA tool based on features established in (i). 
iii) To use the developed Learning Analytic tool to analyze students’ activities on various 
features of selected courses in Moodle system at MUST.

al., 2014). Therefore, there is a need for institu tions to measure the qua lity and intensity of 
LMS usage. In fact, studies have shown that there is a correlation between LMS usage with 
students’ performance (Filippidi et al., 2010;  Jo et al., 2014; Macfadyen & Dawson, 2010; 
Whitmer, 2012) as well as student s’ satisfaction with courses offered via LMS (Naveh et al., 
2012).  
It should be noted that, LMS accumulate va st amounts of data on student behavior 
that can be used to inform and improve st udent engagement in LMS (Beer et al., 2010). 
These information include users visits, num ber of downloads, LMS tools accessed, messages 
read or posted, and content pages visite d (Macfadyen & Dawson, 2010). According to 
Whitmer (2012), such information explain over four times the variation in final grades 
compared to traditional student characteristic  variables, and that combining both types of 
variables increase the quality of predicting learning performance by more than 70%.   
Therefore, through analyzing LMS usage vi a log data we can understand status of 
students’ learning and even predict their possible learning ac hievement (Yu & Jo, 2014). In 
this case, we can identify struggling students in need of academic support (Macfadyen & 
Dawson, 2010). We can also use Learning Analyt ics tools to assess th e quality of online 
postings (Nistor et al., 2015) and visualize usage behaviors in th e system (Scheffel et al., 
2011). 
Given the benefits and opportunities offere d by log data stored in LMS database, 
studies have developed various Learning Analytics tools to anal yze such data. For instance, 
Yu and Jo (2014) studied factors influence st udents’ academic achievement using log data 
collected from Moodle with 84 st udents in a university in Sout h Korea. They found that total 
studying time, interaction with peers, regula rity of learning inte rval, and number of 
downloads had significant e ffect on students’ academic perfomance in online learning 
environment.  
Jo et al. (2014) identified “candidates for proxy variables” from the log data set that 
could be used as factors to de termine students’ performances in courses offered via Moodle. 
The authors used the identified variables to pilot them in commercial eLearning course with a 
total of 200 students. It was reveal ed that an (ir)regularity of th e learning interval showed to 
have correlation with learning performance. 
Kotsiantis et al. (2013) used Learning Anal ytics tool called Moodle Parser to collect 
data from logs and to identify successful learners in blended learning course through students 
activities in Moodle. The study found that students’ failures were associated with their 
negative attitudes and perceptions towards Moodle.  On the other hand, excellent grades were 
associated with increased M oodle usage. The study was based on 337 students enrolled in a 
blended course over three years using Moodle at the University of Patras, Greece. 
Mödritscher and colleagues studied rela tionship between LMS usage patterns and 
students performance using data from system l og. The authors revealed that, topic views had 
positive influence on students’ performance. They also concluded that at-risk students could 
be differentiated from well- performing students by their usage behavior. 
Finally, a study conducted at Central Queensland University using a sample of 92,799 
students, reported a statistic significant correlation between the number of page views and 
students final grades (Beer et al., 2010). In other words, the mo re ‘views’ or visits to the 
course, the higher the final grades. 
These few studies and many others show that  Learning Analytics tools have shown to 
enable institutions to analyze students’ activities and eventually helping in finding strategies 
of helping those who are at risk. In the same  way, this study developed Learning Analytics

INDINGS 
The regression analysis was conducted separa tely for each course. Before conducting 
regression analysis, multicollinearity test and Pearson correlation  were conducted.  
5.1 Multicollinearity Test  
Multicollinearity refers to when variables ar e measuring the same thing, meaning that those 
variable are highly correlated. The presence of multicollinearity shows that ‘R’ which is 
correlation coefficient, is a joint influence and hence prevents to perform multiple linear 
regressions. A tolerance error of  less than 0.2 or 0.1 and/ or VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) 
of 5 or 10 and above indicates the presence of multicollinearity problem among the factors

A total of 111 NTA 6 students taking A pplied Biology I, a nd 60 NTA 7 students 
taking Services and Installation II course in the academic year 2014/2015 participated in the 
study. The variables from LMS log was subjected to linear regre ssion with final scores of 
exams of the same academic year. These students were enrolled in two courses offered via

INDINGS 
The regression analysis was conducted separa tely for each course. Before conducting 
regression analysis, multicollinearity test and Pearson correlation  were conducted.  
5.1 Multicollinearity Test  
Multicollinearity refers to when variables ar e measuring the same thing, meaning that those 
variable are highly correlated. The presence of multicollinearity shows that ‘R’ which is 
correlation coefficient, is a joint influence and hence prevents to perform multiple linear 
regressions. A tolerance error of  less than 0.2 or 0.1 and/ or VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) 
of 5 or 10 and above indicates the presence of multicollinearity problem among the factors 
Table 2 shows the tolerance value that is above 0.2 and VIF 
value of less than 5 indicating the absence of joint influence (multicollinearity). The absence 
of multicollinearity justifies the performance of multiple linear regressions.

ISCUSSION 
The present study was aimed to design and deve lop the Learning Analytics tool and use it 
determine the causation between LMS usage and students’ learning performance. The study 
was conducted at MUST with two courses having a total of 171 students. Given the 
penetration and continue adoption of LMS th roughout higher educatio n in Tanzania, it was 
necessary to find out if these sy stems have impact on students’ performance. Therefore, the 
use of Learning Analytics tool which extracts da ta from LMS database files provide a lot of 
information about students activ ities in the system and such information can be used to 
provide informed decisions about possible proble ms and suitable ways to address them more 
effectively (Kotsiantis et al., 2013). 
In this study, variables were solicited from the literature that were used to design and 
develop the Learning Analytics tool. The developed tool was us ed to extract data from two 
courses namely Analysis for Applied Biology and Service and Instal lation IIT offered in 
blended mode at MUST in academic year  2004/2015. Data obtained from LMS usage via 
Learning Analytics tool was then subject to linear regression in order to determine the effect 
of LMS usage on students’ performance. 
Generally, this study found that Peer In teraction (beta value=19.6%), and Forum 
Posts (beta value=77.1%) had significant effect on students’ performance on Applied Biology 
course while Forum Posts (beta value=48.5%),  and Exercise (beta value=51.5%) had an 
impact on students’ performance on Service and Installation IIT course. 
Interestingly, Forum Posts has shown to ha ve significant effect on students’ learning 
performance in both courses. This means, stude nts who were active in the discussion forums 
during course delivery perfor med better that those who were  less active. These findings 
imply that MUST should find strategies that  will increase student s’ participation in 
discussion forums in order to increase student s’ performance. This can be done by grading 
quality and quantity students’ posts in discussion forums.  
This finding seems to be consistent with  studies conducted el sewhere LMS forums 
posts had impact on students’ final grade. For instance, participation frequency in online

DISCUSSION
The present study was aimed to design and develop the Learning Analytics tool and use it determine the causation between LMS usage and students’ learning performance. The study was conducted at MUST with two courses having a total of 171 students. Given the penetration and continue adoption of LMS throughout higher education in Tanzania, it was necessary to find out if these systems have impact on students’ performance. Therefore, the use of Learning Analytics tool which extracts data from LMS database files provide a lot of information about students activities in the system and such information can be used to provide informed decisions about possible problems and suitable ways to address them more effectively (Kotsiantis et al., 2013).
In this study, variables were solicited from the literature that were used to design and develop the Learning Analytics tool. The developed tool was used to extract data from two courses namely Analysis for Applied Biology and Service and Installation IIT offered in blended mode at MUST in academic year 2004/2015. Data obtained from LMS usage via Learning Analytics tool was then subject to linear regression in order to determine the effect of LMS usage on students’ performance.
Generally, this study found that Peer Interaction (beta value=19.6%), and Forum Posts (beta value=77.1%) had significant effect on students’ performance on Applied Biology course while Forum Posts (beta value=48.5%), and Exercise (beta value=51.5%) had an impact on students’ performance on Service and Installation IIT course.

activities was significantly associated with their grades in  a study conducted at University of 
Glamorgan, UK with 122 students (Davies & Graff,  2005). Similar findings were obtained in 
studies conducted in various in stitutions (e.g. Agudo-Peregrin a et al., 2012; Beer et al., 
2010). 
This study also found that Pe er Interaction had impact on students’ performance in 
Analysis for Applied Biology course. This findi ng in accord with recent studies which found 
that student-student interac tion had a significant impact on students’ academic performance 
(Agudo-Peregrina et al., 2012; Yu & Jo, 2014). This implies that, institutions should promote 
for peer interactions amongst students in in order to increase students’ performance in 
courses offered via the LMS.  
Finally, Exercises was found to be the contribu ting factor in student s’ final scores in 
the Service and Installation II course. The resu lt implies that instructors at MUST should 
consider giving their students more exercises in  order to improve their final scores. This 
finding is similar to a study conducted by Diet z-Uhler and Hurn (2013) who found that the 
performance on course assignments predicted students’ final grades in an online course. 
In conclusion, the study has shown that LMS usage have impact in students’ 
performance in courses offered via LMS. Surprisingly, number of downloads, login 
frequency, time spend in the LMS were f ound to have no significant impact on students’ 
performance in both courses.  
7. S UGGESTION FOR THE FUTURE 
Despite these promising results that emerged from this study, some limitations are worth 
noting. The study was based on quantitative results obtained using data stored in LMS 
database. However, logs simply record learne rs’ behavior in LMS, but they do not explain 
why some of the factors were significant and some were not significant. Further research 
should be undertaken to determ ine why other factors were signi ficant while others were not 
using qualitative research design. This can be done by conducti ng interviews or focus group 
discussions with students who were using the LM S or with instructors who used the LMS to 
facilitate these courses.  
In addition, the two courses used in this study were not delivered entirely online. 
They were delivered in blended mode with some face-to-face activitie s taking place. As a 
result, there are many offline activities such as  reading course-related  books, lectures, and 
offline students’ peer interactions could not tracked in the LMS. To develop a full picture of 
the LMS features and activities that contribute d towards students’ performance future studies 
should select courses that are offered entirely online via the LMS.  
Finally, the study examined only two cour ses in one academic year 2014/2015. 
Further research could expand to many courses that are offered in a given semester or for 
selected courses offered in some semesters.  
Despite these limitations, the findings from this study provide a new understanding on 
effect of LMS usage on students’ performance es pecially in blended learning courses. Some 
of the contributions of this research are: 
 The study has shown that Learning Analy tics tools can be used to analyze how 
students use LMS and find ways find strategi es that can be used to maximize LMS 
usage. The majority of LMS adopted in hi gher education in Af rica tend to fail 
partially or totally (Ssekakubo et al., 2011) due  to the fact that re latively few features 
are normally used. The use of Learning Analyt ics tool can be used to identify unused 
features and in turn, institutions can find ways of maximizing usage.
