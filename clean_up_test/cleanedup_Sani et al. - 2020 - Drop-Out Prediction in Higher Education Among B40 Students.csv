Abstract—Malaysia citizens are categorized into three 
different income groups which are the Top 20 Percent (T20), 
Middle 40 Percent (M40), and Bottom 40 Percent (B40).  One of 
the focus areas in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP) is to 
elevate the B40 household group towards the middle -income 
society. In 2018, it was estimated that 4.1 million households 
belong to this group. The government of Malaysia has w idened 
access to higher education for the B40 group in an effort to 
reduce the gaps in socioeconomics and to improve their living 
standards. Statistical data shows that since 2013, a yearly intake 
of students in bachelor's degree programs in Malaysia's pub lic 
universities amounts to more than 85,000. Despite this huge 
number of enrolments, not all were able to graduate, including 
students from low -income family background. Data mining 
approach with machine learning techniques has been widely used 
effectively and accurately to predict students at risk of dropping 
out in general education. However, machine learning related 
works on student attrition in Malaysia's higher education is 
generally lacking. Therefore, in this research, three machine 
learning models were developed using Decision Tree, Random 
Forest and Artificial Neural Network algorithm in order to 
classify attrition among B40 students in bachelor's degree 
programs in Malaysia's public universities. Comparative 
performance analysis between the three models indicates that the 
Random Forest model is the best model in predicting student 
attrition in this study. Random Forest model outperforms the 
other two models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F -
measure with the value of 95.93%, 97.10%, 81.26% and 88. 50%, 
respectively. Nevertheless, there is a statistically significant 
difference in performance between the Random Forest model 
and Decision Tree model but no statistically significant difference 
between Random Forest models and Artificial Neural Network 
model.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Malaysia's household income is classified into three 
groups, which are Bottom 40% (B40), Middle 40% (M40) and 
Top 20% (T20). According to the Department of Statistic, 
Malaysia (2017), generally in Malaysia, B40 household 
income is not more than RM 4,630.00. Approximately, there 
were 2.7 million households belonging to B40 group in 2014. 
The figures increas ed in 2018, as the government announced 
that 4.1 million households will continue to benefit from 
Bantuan Sara Hidup (Household Living Aid) (BSH) which is 
specially allocated to B40 group [1]. 
B40 had been selected as a focus group in Rancangan 
Malaysia 11 2016-2020 (The Eleventh Malaysia Plan) (RMK -
11). Through RMK-11, the government used education as one 
of the strategies to boost B40 household's income and 
ultimately narrowing socioeconomic gap [1] -[2]. Higher 
education institution and skills training in stitutes were 
encouraged to allocate more seats  and allowing admission by 
special allocation for B40 students in an effort to ensure their 
access to higher education is secured . As reported in Higher 
Education Statistic, from the year 2011 to 2015, the tot al 
number of student s intake for bachelor 's degree programmes 
in Malaysia Public Universities is more than 85,000 students 
yearly. The highest number of students intake was recorded in 
the year 2011 with 99,862 students . Nonetheless, not all were 
able to graduate on time . In a worse case, some dropped out 
voluntarily or were expelled from by university. 
Student's attrition in university will negatively affect B40 
students financially. The f amily financial burden will increase 
as student's education loan ha s to be paid even if they fail to 
graduate. Fu rthermore, it will affect a student's chances on 
securing a high-income job. Students drop out would also lead 
to a huge loss in human capitals to the nation  as fewer 
professionals and expert skills will be  produced by public 
universities. 
Hence, a proactive approach is desperately needed in 
identifying students who are at risk at dropping out . A n 
effective prediction model using machine learning technique 
can be implemented for that purpose . Thus, the aim of th is 
paper is to conduct a comparative study for machine learning 
models in predicting attrition among B40 students, particularly 
in the bachelor's degree programme in Malaysia Public 
Universities. Decision Tree (DT) Random Forest (RF), and 
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms were adopted in 
constructing the models. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

classification technique in education and student drop -out 
prediction in highe r learning institutions. Section 3 describes 
the methodology used in predicting student's drop out in this 
research. Results and discussion will be discussed in

II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
Classification is a machine learning technique that can be 
used to predict students drop out rate accurately to help 
reducing student attrition rate. The task is crucial as the ability 
to predict students at risk the earliest possible is a great help to 
keep students from leaving their studies and overcome 
attrition among B40 students. Classification te chnique had 
been developed and applied successfully to a wide range of 
real-world domains [3]  – [8]. Also, the cl assification is 
playing an important role in the education domain, especially 
in predicting student 's academic performance,  whether in 
school or higher education institution [9]. The resea rch had 
review 30 studies carried out in between year 2002 until ear ly 
2015 and discovered that Artificial Neural Network (ANN), 
Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), k -Nearest Neighbour 
(k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were often used 
in building prediction models. However, findings showed that 
ANN and DT models pr oduced higher accuracy results than 
the others. 
Over recent years, there has been a significant growth of 
research published in predicting student performance , 
focusing on course drop -out/ retention using the technique of 
classification (supervised learnin g). These researches 
concentrate on predicting final grade or Cumulative Grade 
Point Average (CGPA) of students by utilizing classifier 
algorithm [10]-[13], predicting student's performance in 
Massive Online Open Courses  (MOOC) environment [14], 
and predicting students at risk of not graduating high school 
on time [15]. 
In Malaysia, classification techniques had been applied in 
education domain , but the focus was more on student 
performance rather than attrition. Reference [16 ] in their work 
designed a model to identify key factors that influence the 
drop-out rates in Computer Science course . They collected 
student's demographic information and transcript records 
which focused on the core courses  offered as it gives more 
impact on the drop -out case. Four  different classification 
techniques namely k -NN, DT, NN and Logistic Regression 
(LR) are utilized to classify the dataset. The results show that 
LR classifier is the most accurate (91%) as compared to other 
techniques used in this work. The outcome of thi s work 
reveals that there are five important courses that the student 
must score higher to lower the chance of dropping out. 
Bedregal Alpaca et al.  [17] proposed classification models 
based on academic information provided by university to 
identify a stude nt at risk of drop- out. The student' s 
demographic, academic performance, admission test and 
course information data are considered for the evaluation. 
From the result , it is observed that the model is able to 
determine the most significant variable that af fects academic 
performance, which is the abandoned subjects. 
Gil, Delima, and Vilchez [18] adapted DT and NB to 
identify the underlying factors of student drop -out in a public 
school in the Philippines. They used Weka tool kit to utilize 
the classifier algorithm on the selected dataset and produced a 
comparative result of each algorithm performance in terms of 
recall, precision and accuracy. Meanwhile, [19 ] only 
concentrated on k -NN to perform extensive evaluation and 
predict student drop -out at an early st age of study. The 
technique is versatile, simple and can handle different type of 
data. The results can help teachers to identify a student at risk 
of drop-out and check on their welfare. 
Mardolkar and Kumaran [20] adapted data mining 
technique to find comprehensive prediction models of student 
drop-out as early as possible. The model with sufficiently high 
accuracy will be used in an early warning system as an effort 
to detect students at high risk of drop- out as soon as possible. 
They explored the academic variables (both at universities and 
former school), sociodemography, behaviour and 
extracurricular activities that may influence student drop -out. 
However, only a subset of attributes that ha s a very high 
predictive contribution on the student drop-out. 
Tomasevic, Gvozdenovic and Vranes [21] conducted a 
research with an objective to provide a comprehensive 
analysis and comparison of supervised machine learning 
techniques for discovering students at a high risk of dropping 
out from the course. For this, they used various classifier such 
as k-NN, SVM, ANN, DT, NB  and LR as the classification 
tool. The overall highest precision was obtained with ANN by 
feeding the algorithm with student engagement data in online 
learning and past performance data. 
Viloria and Padilla [22] in their study applied NN, DT  and 
Bayesian Network  to predict drop -out among engineering 
students in India. As a result, it was found that academic 
results and socioeconomic situation have an influence on 
students and managing these variables helps reduce the drop -
out rate. 
Sangodiah et al.  [23] used SVM to predict academic 
performance for students under probation in a private higher 
learning institution. The model gained 89.84% of accuracy. 
Likewise, [24] also used single classifier to predict 
postgraduate doctoral degree students that will complete their 
study on time by using Binary Linear Regression. The 
outcome revealed that only 6.8% of the students in the year 
2014 were able to graduate on time. 
Table I described 16 studies conducted in predicting 
student drop out in higher learning institution from the year 
2015 until 2020. The studies indicated that academic and 
sociodemographic data were important  features used in 
predicting student. Other than that , there was only one 
research in predicting student drop- out that use s data from 
server logs contain ing student's activities for online courses 
offered from various universities. All of the research reviewed 
here were targeting students from only  one cours e/major in 
one faculty or similar institution . However, in this research, 
the focus will be shifted to predicting drop out among B40 
students by using academic or soc iodemographic data from 
various majors and various higher learning institutions (public 
universities).

Comparative studies of two or more prediction models had 
been the core for 13 studies while the remaining used single 
classifier. In comparing prediction models performance, DT 
was the main choice among the researchers which was used in 
11 studies followed by NB/ k- NN (six studies), RF (five 
studies) and ANN/ SVM (four studies). Based on the review, 
it can be concluded that DT is the most popular choice among 
the researchers in predicting student drop out as it is easy to 
comprehend and produce high-performance prediction results. 
Other than that, over the recent years, classification model 
using ensemble learning, especially RF had been increasingly 
popular among researchers because the performance outcome 
is very high as compared to a single classifier. Thus, a 
comparative study between classifier, particularly DT, ANN 
and RF is very much needed to discover the best prediction 
models for student drop-out among B40 students.

ESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
In general, this research was conducted in three phases 
which were Phase I – Feasibility Study, Phase II – Data 
Preparation ad Phase III – Modeling and Evaluation.  Fig. 1 
shows detailed activities for each phase in research 
methodology. Fig. 1 illustrated phases and details of activities 
for each phase for research method ology in this study. There 
were three softwares used in this study, which were 
RapidMiner for prediction models construction and 
performance evaluation, MariaDB database to store and pre -
process data, along with SPSS for attribute selection and 
statistical test. 
A. Data Preparation 
1) Data acquisition:  The dataset was provided by 
Bahagian Pembangunan dan Perancangan Dasar (BPPD), 
Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia (Pendidikan Tinggi) which 
consists of 44,406 records with 23 attributes. The dataset 
holds student's re cords from 20 public universities for 
bachelor degree programmes, who have dropped out or 
graduated from the year 2014 to 2017 intake. 
2) Data Pre -processing: Pre-processing of data is a 
method of transforming a dataset in order to better expose the 
information quality to the mining tool. Real world data is 
often incomplete, incoherent and can contain noise such as 
errors and outliers. Pre-processing data is therefore required to 
ensure that data is formatted for a given miner tool and must 
be adequate for a g iven method. Data cleaning was performed 
using dimension reduction process. Attributes with more than 
20,000 data unavailable, redundant or obsolete were deleted 
from the dataset. Incomplete records or outliers were also 
discarded (Table II). Data cleaning  also ensured that the 
dataset included only student records with B40 household 
income (not more than RM4,387.00).

Next, the data were transformed into a structure or 
understandable format befitting data mining. There were two 
new attributes constructed from existing attributes which were 
age from date_of_birth and class from student_status. 
Attribute class was the class label in this study. In attribute 
student_status, records with data' Berhenti' or 'Diberhentikan' 
were translated into 'C' i n attribute class which represented 
students who dropped out while records with data' Tamat' 
were translated into 'G' which represented students who 
manage to graduate. Fur thermore, attributes with varieties of 
data were aggregated or generalized by using the hierarchical 
concept. 
Only relevant attributes were selected and used in bu ilding 
the prediction models. For this reason, the Chi-Square test was 
used to assess the relationship between attributes and the class 
label. Attributes with test result  p < 0.05 were considered 
having significant association with the class label. Afterwards, 
further tests were performed using Phi  (𝜙𝜙) or Cramer's V (V) 
to each associated attribute in order to measure the strength of 
association. The value of 𝜙𝜙 or V is between 0 to 1, with 1 
being the strongest and 0 being the weakest. The interpretation 
of the association between attributes and class label is , as 
shown in Table III. 
Refer to Table IV , Chi-Square test results showed that all 
attributes had a significa nt association with the class label as 
the p-value for each att ribute that was less than 0.05. 
However, based on Cramer's V/Phi test result, place_of_birth 
and family_income were discarded from the dataset as their 
association level with the class label ca n be ignored. The final 
dataset for model construction consisted of 28,844 records  
with 9 regular attributes and 1  special attribute (class)  
(Table V). 
B. Descriptive Analysis 
Table VI and Table VII report the statistical analysis for 
each attribute after pre -processing data activity. Students who 
dropped out ( class ' C') only represented 19.22% data in this 
study as compared to 80.78%  of students who managed to 
graduate (class 'G'). More than half of  the students ( 59.47 %) 
come from UiTM while UKM had the lowest number of 
students (0.21%).

Majority of B40 students managed to obtain a CGPA 
higher than 2.00 in the first year of their study. Nearly 40% of 
the students obtained their first year CGPA between 3.00 –  
3.49. Even though students with first CGPA lower than 2.00 
percentage is the lowest (13%), this group is most likely to 
drop-out as almost  all of the students ( 98.84 % ) did not 
continue their study. Business and Adminis tration programme 
group contributed the largest number of students ( 10,809 
students followed by Engineering ( 3,976 students) and the 
lowest was Transport Service with only one student. Further 
analysis also found that six out of ten programme groups with 
most number s of students that dropped out and obtained  
CGPA lower than 2.00 were from Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) major (Engineering, 
Computing, Manifacuturing and Processing, Mathematics and 
Statistics, Physical Science and Architecture). 
Almost two -third of B40 students ( 63.61%) self -funded 
their study while the balance (36.39%) used education loan or 
received financial aid from government agencies, a private 
institution, foundation or other sources. Self -funded students 
were also presumed to drop- out as 60% of  the students quit 
their study. Being a part -time student also can be a 
disadvantage, as 99.47% of them failed to graduate. Students 
who were single got a higher chance of  finishing their degree 
as their percentage of dropping out was very low as compared 
to married or divorced/widowed students. When it comes to 
gender, over 70%  of students in this study were female , but 
their drop out rate is 15.61% lower than male students. Finally, 
students in the age group o 20 years o ld and below when 
enrolled in a bachelor degree programme are most likely to 
drop-out than students in the age group 21 years and above. 
C. Modelling and Evaluation 
1) Model construction and testing: Each prediction model 
(DT, RF and ANN) was tested beforehand to determine the 
validation method and algorithms parameters that can be used 
to produce high performance prediction model. All nine 
attributes were used in validation method testing and 
parameter tuning. Prediction model validation w as tested 
using holdout ( 70 % – 30% and  60% – 40%) and 10- folds 
cross-validation methods, and the latter was chosen as it gave 
the highest accuracy results for the majority of the models. 
Next, each prediction model also was constructed repeatedly 
by using a different parameter to achieve highest accuracy 
result. Parameter tuning results are as shown in Table VIII, 
and these parameters were used in building the final prediction 
models.

Majority of B40 students managed to obtain a CGPA 
higher than 2.00 in the first year of their study. Nearly 40% of 
the students obtained their first year CGPA between 3.00 –  
3.49. Even though students with first CGPA lower than 2.00 
percentage is the lowest (13%), this group is most likely to 
drop-out as almost  all of the students ( 98.84 % ) did not 
continue their study. Business and Adminis tration programme 
group contributed the largest number of students ( 10,809 
students followed by Engineering ( 3,976 students) and the 
lowest was Transport Service with only one student. Further 
analysis also found that six out of ten programme groups with 
most number s of students that dropped out and obtained  
CGPA lower than 2.00 were from Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) major (Engineering, 
Computing, Manifacuturing and Processing, Mathematics and 
Statistics, Physical Science and Architecture). 
Almost two -third of B40 students ( 63.61%) self -funded 
their study while the balance (36.39%) used education loan or 
received financial aid from government agencies, a private 
institution, foundation or other sources. Self -funded students 
were also presumed to drop- out as 60% of  the students quit 
their study. Being a part -time student also can be a 
disadvantage, as 99.47% of them failed to graduate. Students 
who were single got a higher chance of  finishing their degree 
as their percentage of dropping out was very low as compared 
to married or divorced/widowed students. When it comes to 
gender, over 70%  of students in this study were female , but 
their drop out rate is 15.61% lower than male students. Finally, 
students in the age group o 20 years o ld and below when 
enrolled in a bachelor degree programme are most likely to 
drop-out than students in the age group 21 years and above.

Different numbers of attributes were used in building final 
prediction models. At first, the models were build with 
attributes that had moderate to strong relationship with class 
label. Subsequently, attributes with weak relationship were 
added one-by-one based on attribute ranking. The importance 
of weak attributes can't be neglected as they might be useful in 
producing high performance prediction models. Table IX  
shows attribute representation for final models construction. 
2) Model evaluation: Prediction model's performance was 
evaluated by comparing the value of accuracy, precision, 
recall and F measure. Those values were calculated based on 
the confusion matrix technique , as shown in Table X . 
Prediction results and actual class were put in a matrix for 
comparison depending on a positive and negative value. Class 
'C' was marked as positive value while class 'G' was negative. 
In addition to performance comparison, the statistical test 
was performed to decide the best prediction model. This study 
used the McNemar test to determine if there was a significant 
difference statistically to the proportion of error between two 
prediction models with a significance level of 0.05 (α = 0.05). 
The significant difference between the proportion of error of 
two prediction models is also interpreted as a significant 
difference in performance between two prediction models  
(Dietterich, 1998).

The results indicated that RF model gives the highest

by ANN with 95.86% and DT with 95.84%.  The highest 
accuracy for RF model w as produced with seven attributes

for RF model with six attributes was higher than ANN and DT 
models with the same number of attributes (refer Fig.  2). 
Consistently, RF also yields a  higher accuracy rate than the 
other two models , even by applying different numbers of

ANN (6 attributes) 95.86 81.08 96.89 0.883 
Performance between prediction models w as evaluated by 
comparing the value of accuracy, recall, precision and F 
measure (refer Table XI ). Aside from accuracy, the results  
also showed that RF leads ANN and DT with regards to recall 
value with 81.26%, 81.03% and 80.99%. This means that RF 
model succeeded in predicting more students who will drop -
out (class 'C') correctly from the total number of student who 
were actually dropped out in this study.  Likewise, the highest 
value for precision was also recorded by RF with 97.10% 
which means that the model was able to predict more class 'C' 
precisely from the total number of students who were 
predicted to drop -out. ANN took second place in p recision 
with 96.89% while DT the last place with 96.83%. When 
comparing F measure, RF also the highest with 0.885, 
followed by ANN with 0.883 and DT with 0.882. 
Generally, RF is the best model in predicting drop -out 
among B40 students in this st udy as it outperformed the other 
two models with reference to accuracy, recall, precision and F 
measure, subsequently ANN and DT models. Nevertheless, 
the difference in accuracy and F measure value between the 
three models were very narrow , with 0.07% to 0.09% and 
0.002% to 0.003%, respectively. Hence, the statistical test 
(McNemar) results were referred to in determining a 
significant difference in performance between the prediction 
models. 
Based on Table XII , McNemar test results proved that 
statistically: 
1) DT and RF models had a significant difference  in 
proportion of error; 
2) DT and ANN mod els had no significant difference  in 
proportion of error; and 
3) ANN and RF models had no significant difference  in 
proportion of error. 
This implied that even  though RF is the best model in 
predicting drop-out among B40 students in this study, there is  
a significant difference in performance only between RF and 
DT, but contrarily, no significant difference in performance 
between RF and ANN.

V. CONCLUSION 
Drop-out prediction among B40 students in bachelor's 
degree programmes can be implemented by using 
classification technique. Prediction model using RF was 
selected as the best model in this study as it outperformed 
ANN and DT in accuracy, recall, precision and F measure. 
However, statistically, the difference in performance was only 
significant between RF and DT, not between RF and ANN. 
Results of this research are expected to benefit B40 
students, public universities and the government. Early 
prevention steps can be deployed by public universities to 
avoid drop-out to produc e more graduates. B40 students who 
are at risk to drop-out will be able to graduate with the help of 
their university and getting better job opportunities that will 
improve their soc ioeconomic status. These students also will 
become assets to the governmen t as professionals and skilful 
worker that can be contributed to the nation's future 
development. 
In future, this study can be furthered by applying 
regression technique to predict when attrition will happen with 
the additional data of students who are sti ll studying and the 
exact date of drop -out. Besides, the association rule technique 
can be applied to discover hidden patterns tha t can be used to 
identify students at risk , and the results can be verified by the 
experts from the ministry or universities.
