Abstract. Metacognitive competencies related to cognitive tasks have
been shown to be a powerful predictor of learning. However, considerably
less is known about the relationship between student’s metacognition re-
lated to non-cognitive dimensions, such as their aﬀect or lifestyles, and
academic performance. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of
data gathered by Performance Learning Education (PL), with respect to
students’ self-reports on non-cognitive dimensions as possible predictors
of their academic outcomes. The results point to the predictive poten-
tial of such self-reports, to the importance of students exercising their
self-understanding during learning, and to the potentially critical role of
incorporating such student’s self-reports in learner modelling.
1 Introduction
Academic performance is typically measured through assessments on
standardised tests, which are often used formatively together with teach-
ers’ assessments of students’ attitudes and motivation to predict ﬁnal
grades on high-stake exams. However, there is no standardised way in
which the predicted grades do actually reﬂect students’ attitudinal and
motivational traits. Although the importance of students’ emotions, mo-
tivation and lifestyles to learning is conﬁrmed by substantial research
[1], the lack of teacher training with respect to ’diagnosing’ students
motivation and attitudes, coupled with the known challenges related to
accessing reliably other people’s mental states (e.g. [2], leads to a whole
variety of subjective judgements which are hard to validate and opera-
tionalise in everyday educational practices.
Owing to a prevalent emphasis on subject-speciﬁc education together
with a predominantly didactic, ’ teacher in charge of the assessments’
approaches that are adopted in mainstream education, one aspect which
is often overlooked in school contexts is the value of engaging students in
their own assessments, for example through self-reporting on how they
feel, what motivates them and what they consider the possible barri-
ers to their learning. Such self-assessments, involving the metacognitive
competencies of self-monitoring, play a crucial role in allowing students
to reﬂect on their experiences, motivation and attitudes and in help-
ing them ﬁrst, to understand their own behaviours, and second, to plan
actions, set goals and aspirations, and ultimately – to make informed
decisions [3].","Leveraging Non-Cognitive Student Self-Reports

students in relation to socio-emotional, attitudinal and life-style choices

In this paper we present a preliminary analysis of data generated by
Performance Learning Education (PL) in live high-stakes intervention
contexts in two schools (A and B), involving a total of 48 students aged
16-17 preparing for pre-university examinations. We describe the self-
reporting instrument (PLOA) used to elicit responses from the students
on key aspects of their socio-emotional states and lifestyle habits related
to a potential risk of their underachieving in their exams.

PLOA
PL supports schools in raising students’ academic achievement as mea-
sured through high-stakes exams, which are required for entry to uni-
versity, further educational, or professional development. The company
works at all levels of education from primary and secondary, through fur-
ther education to the university level. Its main user base are state-funded
schools catering for pupil cohorts from low socio-economic backgrounds.
The attainment in those schools tends to be poor and often below na-
tional average, with many pupils leading hectic lives and not prioritising
or valuing academic achievement.
PL’s approach emphasises the importance of students developing a good
understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses along with the pos-
sible causes for both. Its approach is structured around four overlapping
trait categories known to be of critical importance to students’ learn-
ing and development: (i) motivation, linked to student’s goal orienta-
tion; (ii) organisation related to the executive functions of planning and
attentional control; (iii) memory broadly related to attentional control
and cognitive ﬂexibility; (iv) lifestyle related to sleep and physical and
emotional wellbeing of the students. There are two elements to PL: (1)
self-assessment by students aimed to ascertain their strengths and weak-
nesses along the four trait categories described; (2) curriculum, which
coaches students in how to attend to speciﬁc aspects of their lifestyles,

are used to elicit self-assessment from individual students in relation to
the four categories assessed. Student’s responses are scaﬀolded through
multiple choice questions that are associated with each trait category,
each question linked to a risk level (1: low risk, to 5: high risk), with
each level representing the relative degree to which a particular trait
may be a barrier to a given student’s academic achievement. For exam-
ple, if under the motivation category a student declares that they cannot
cope with and tend to panic under pressure, this is linked to a relatively
high PLOA risk level. PLOA scores associated with each student answer
choice are aggregated at the end of the assessment and an overall PLOA
is calculated using a PL’s proprietary weighted means function which is
further associated with percentage ranges; the lower the percentage, the
higher the PLOA risk level. For further details about PL’s approach and
the development thereof see [6].
3 Data analysis and Results
Two UK schools which use PL as an approach to raise student attainment
have been included in the analysis presented. Both are co-educational
secondary schools, catering for between 400 (School A) and 1300 (School
B) pupils aged 11-18 years old. In both schools there is an equal boy-
girl ratio and both schools have a medium to high free school meals
percentage which is used as a key socio-economic school indicator in the
UK. Additionally, school A has a special educational needs provision for
pupils with moderate learning diﬃculties.
Initial and ﬁnal PLOA, gathered before and after PL intervention, were
used in the analysis, along with the estimated exam grades (EEGs) and
ﬁnal exam grades. Both sets of grades were provided by the schools and
were based on subject-speciﬁc tests and, in case of EEGs, on test results
and assessments of individual students’ attitude and overall eﬀort in
each subject. For both schools Pearson correlations coeﬃcient analysis
revealed signiﬁcant correlations between students’ PLOA and their ﬁnal
overall grades (School A N = 35, r = .583, p < .001); (School B N = 13,
r = .878, p < .001). Partial correlations analysis for each subject for
which PL intervention was given, revealed a similar pattern. In addition,
a paired-samples t-test was conducted to test the change in the initial
and ﬁnal PLOA. As expected, this signiﬁcant increase was also apparent
in each school. School A: Initial PLOA ( M = 48 .522, SD = 10 .293)
vs. ﬁnal PLOA ( M = 53.456, SD = 11.617) t(34) = 12 .646, p <0.00;
School B: Initial PLOA ( M = 56.269, SD = 10.934) vs. the ﬁnal PLOA
(M = 56.654, SD = 11.998), t(12) = 7.028, p <0.00.
As part of a regression analysis, we explored the respective potential of (i)
the EEGs and (ii) EEGs together with PLOA in predicting the ﬁnal exam
grades. The results show that EEGs alone explain 26 .1% of the variance
of the average ﬁnal score, whereas EEGs with PLOA explain 29 .7% of
the variance. This statistically signiﬁcant increase in variance suggests
that using both predictors as part of a regression model is more accurate
when EEGs and PLOA are used together. The results are summarised
in Table 1.","Twenty eight questions

comes (here as measured by exam grades) in order to oﬀer personalised
support to diﬀerent students, we also aggregated the data across schools
and subjects. As expected, there is a signiﬁcant increase in the PLOA for
the aggregated data set t(47) = 7 .028, p= p < .00. The corresponding
regression analysis also resulted in a signiﬁcant model,F(2, 45) = 19.383,
p < .001, r = .680, R2 = .463 with both EEGs and PLOA being signif-
icant predictors ( scoref = −1.166 + .617 ∗ scorei + .053 ∗ ploaf , stan-
dardized Beta scorei = .416, ploaf = .459, p < .000).
4 Discussion and Conclusions
Whilst the main limitation of the analysis presented is that it is based
on small number of students, the fact that the PLOA increases signiﬁ-
cantly suggests that the PL’s curriculum, which coaches students in how
to attend to speciﬁc aspects of their lifestyles, attitudes, emotions and
goal management is eﬀective. The regression analysis suggests that ﬁnal
PLOA together with EEGs predict the ﬁnal scores better than either
one alone. To contextualise this, the regression function together with
the corresponding coeﬃcients indicate that as the average initial score
increases the average ﬁnal score will increase by around 62% (if the ﬁ-
nal PLOA is held constant). Similarly, as the ﬁnal PLOA increases by
one unit (one percentage), the average ﬁnal score will increase by 5% (if
the initial score is held constant). Considering that these results were
generated in low-achieving schools in which the students taking part in
the PL intervention are the lowest of the achievers, together with the
fact that the intervention was of a relatively short duration (a total
of eight hours per school), provides a particularly powerful motivation
for investing further in understanding and modelling the relationship
between students’ self-explanations and metacognitive competencies, es-
pecially as relates to students’ attitudes, motivation and lifestyles, and
their academic achievement in high-stakes exams. The results also sug-
gest that providing a systematic and consistent way in which student’s
can self-report on those ’non-cognitive’ aspects of their learning may be
an important learning and assessment tool.
In summary, the results of the analysis presented in this paper are promis-
ing with respect to supporting the long-term goal of this research to de-
