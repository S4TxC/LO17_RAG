ABSTRACT Big data analytics has shown tremendous success in several ﬁelds such as businesses,
agriculture, health, and meteorology, and education is no exception. Concerning its role in education, it is
used to boost students’ learning process by predicting their performance in advance and adapting the relevant
instructional design strategies. This study primarily intends to develop a system that can predict students’
performance and help teachers to timely introduce corrective interventions to uplift the performance of low-
performing students. As a secondary part of this research, it also explores the potential of collaborative
learning as an intervention to act in combination with the prediction system to improve the performance
of students. To support such changes, a visualization system is also developed to track and monitor the
performance of students, groups, and overall class to help teachers in the regrouping of students concerning
their performance. Several well-known machine learning models are applied to predict students performance.
Results suggest that experimental groups performed better after treatment than before treatment. The students
who took part in each class activity, prepared and submitted their tasks perform much better than other
students. Overall, the study found that collaborative learning methods play a signiﬁcant role to enhance the
learning capability of the students.

I. INTRODUCTION
Educational institutes are striving to enhance the learning
capabilities of the students and this is primarily achieved
by devising novel methods and approaches for elevating the
standards of the content taught to the students. Students
and teachers are the key stakeholders of institutes and their
success makes a huge impact on the social and economic
development of a country. However, in the sprint for
providing the rich educational material the most important
element is either ignored or completely overlooked which is
analytics. Learning analytics aims at data gathering, analysis,
and reporting of important indicators for students with respect
to their academic performance. It provides insights about
students’ performance using various performance markers.
However, such analysis is not possible without the temporal

and user-friendly system is needed to collect the data, predict

integrate traditional teaching methods with ICT technology
to improve teaching and learning quality in large institu-
tions. Learning analytics provide powerful tools to help
teachers improve the effectiveness of their courses and
enhance students’ performance through an iterative process.
The key purpose of learning analytics is to provide a
structure for educational institutes and administrators to
standardize student data collections to analyze their academic
success.
Learning analytics is the assessment, compilation, inter-
pretation, and monitoring of students within the provided
settings [2], [3]. It is considered an effective method because
it helps to predict individual students’ success, improve future
course outcomes, boost the retention rate, improve the overall
quality of teaching and provide better support in decision
making [3], [4].
Learning analytics improves the performance of a student
by identifying the factors that inﬂuence their performance.
For this purpose, the data is gathered from educational
institutions or by using a questionnaire to evaluate student
progress in the early weeks of the course. After identifying the
student at risk, teacher then can execute timely intervention
and additional training for the weak students [5]–[7].
A solution to introduce early intervention is developed where
the instructor can incorporate learning analytics for providing
feedback to a student in real-time.
Learning analytics is used in different ways to predict stu-
dent performance such as the speed at which students grasp
the concepts from the courses taught during a semester [8].
Similarly, students’ performance can be predicted from
students’ digital footprints i.e., demographics, behavioral
logs, and face emotion monitoring while using an intelligent
tutoring system [8]–[10].
Collaborative learning is a scenario where students work
or learn in small communities in which they can collaborate
and learn with respect to each other’s expertise. Group
work impacts many facets of a group project, such as
working together to solve challenges, completing assign-
ments, or discovering new ideas. The collaborative structure
is established to access the students’ teamwork behaviors,
cooperation, individual effort, common experience, and self-
adopted teamwork roles.
Collaborative learning has been regarded as important
owing to its capability of incorporating powerful strategies
to enhance learning. The implementation of collaborative
learning depends upon teacher perceptions and opinions of
collaborative learning. There are a lot of discrete ways of
organizing student groups, such as teacher-selected groups
and student-selected groups [11], [12]. In student-selected
groups, the group structure is often homogeneous where
the high performing students, low performing students, or
the students from the same-sex may form a group. On the
other hand, in the case of teacher-selected groups, the
composition is often heterogeneous involving the students
with different skill levels or sex groups. Teacher-selected
groups perform much better because teachers are strongly
skilled to form a group of relative students to enhance their
learning capabilities.
The computer-supported learning process has attracted
considerable interest in the education ﬁeld over the years.
In addition to offering a more ﬂexible way for students to
learn skills, it encourages students to collaborate closely with
their peers. In traditional learning especially in Pakistan,
teachers face problems dealing with a large number of
students. One way to overcome this problem is to support
collaborative learning through online education portals and
learning systems [13]–[15]. Interestingly, a lot of work has
been done to predict the learning outcomes of students
and future performance with respect to e-learning tools
[7], [16]. However, very limited work has been done in the
conventional learning domain, especially for Asian students
and particularly for Pakistani students [17]. This study
investigates the effects of group composition, collaborative
learning behavior, and academic performance in a computer-
supported collaborative learning environment, especially in
the context of Pakistan. The objective of this research is to
ﬁll this gap and develop an integrated framework to provide
collaborative learning. In a nutshell, this study makes the
following contributions
• A framework is designed that can highlight the students
at-risk during the early weeks of a course and assist
weak students by promoting collaborative learning.
It provides a visualization system to track and monitor
the performance of students, groups, and overall class to
help teachers in the regrouping of students concerning
their performance.
• A large dataset is gathered using a questionnaire
from the COMSATS university Pakistan undergradu-
ate students. Several machine learning classiﬁers are
applied such as logistic regression (LR), K nearest
neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), support vector
machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), decision trees (DT),
and an ensemble-based model, to predict the future
performance of the students.
• This research explores the potential of learning analytics
and collaborative learning for an introductory program-
ming course. It evaluates the potential of collaborative
learning as an intervention to act in combination with
the prediction system to improve the performance of
students.
To achieve the above-mentioned goals, this study formu-
lates the following three research questions:
1) Whether existing identiﬁed factors for students’ per-
formance prediction are valid in the local context of
Pakistan?
2) Which are the most important features that help
accurate prediction of students’ performance?
3) Is it possible to improve the performance of a student
by collaborative learning?
The rest of the paper is divided into four sections. Section II
discusses several important works related to the current
study. The proposed framework is described along with its

II. RELATED WORK
The general motivation for this research is supporting higher
education students and institutions to achieve better academic
performance. On different occasions, prominent work has
been done for learning analysis in educational sciences,
such as predicting course outcomes, identifying students at
risk, automating tutoring, detecting student characteristics,
predicting learning behaviors, determining the level of
engagement, and much more. Since this study incorporates
both learning analytics and collaborative learning, the
research works related to both these topics are discussed here.
A. LEARNING ANALYTICS
The authors [3], [18] provide a brief overview of learning
analytics, its use in educational institutions, available learning
analytics tools, and how students’ performance can be moni-
tored. In addition, the study elaborates on several challenges
associated with using learning analytics concerning higher
education. Studies aim at highlighting the data that instructors
can use to improve the students’ performance. Similarly, the
authors focused on the understanding of learning analytics
applications, testing approaches, methodology, and use of
learning analytics in advanced studies [4]. The goal of
this study is to validate four hypotheses regarding learning
analytics as to whether learning analytics boosts learning
outcomes, facilitates learning and teaching, and its use is
comprehensive and ethical. Overall, the ﬁndings suggest
that the evidence of developments in student outcomes is
supported by 9%, teaching and learning assistance by 35%,
comprehensive use by 6%, and ethical use by 18%. Study [5]
investigates the use of various machine learning algorithms
to predict the students’ performance in the early weeks of
the course. For this purpose, NB, DT, RF, SVM, neural
network (NN), CN2 rules, and KNN are used to analyze
their performance on collected data from 76 students. Results
showed that the KNN algorithm shows better performance at
the end of the term with 89% accuracy and 74% accuracy in
the early weeks.
The authors propose an approach to identify students at
risk at the start of the course in [6]. A predictive framework
is developed to estimate student ﬁnal grades in the third
week of the course by using data gathered for teachers. The
framework is applied to ﬁve courses taught by three different
professors at two different universities. Various standard
machine learning techniques such as RF, SVM, and AdaBoost
are applied to simulate the success of two different courses
and then transfer-learning techniques are applied to analyze
their performance. Results indicate that RF performs well
with respect to F1- scores in conventional machine learning
systems but transfer learning models perform signiﬁcantly
better than conventional models. Similarly, the authors
propose a new PredictCS tool in [19] to automatically
detect and give feedback to low-performing learners in
a programming course. PredictCS takes students’ proﬁles,
prior academic outcomes, programming course assignments,
and contextual experiences as inputs to predict the success
of a student. Results show that laboratory grades and overall
performance is improved for those students who modify
their projects and resubmit them based on the feedback.
In a similar fashion, the authors in [20] identify students
facing the risk of poor performance and suggest feedback
to improve the probability of success. Additionally, students
receive personalized feedback to avoid possible failure and
increase the chances to pass the course. The data gathered
for 53000 students from the online platform is used with a
gradual at-risk (GAR) model. The case study showed that
a small improvement in performance is found but results
do not show conclusive evidence that such improvements
are based on the early warning system (EWS). The authors
investigate predicting classiﬁers in [21] that can be used to
analyze students’ data. Three machine learning are developed
for prediction, such as linear regression, DT, and NB. Results
suggest that NB can obtain the highest accuracy for predicting
high school students’ scores for a math course.
For the early estimation of the ﬁnal academic success of
students, [7] recommends blended learning comprising both
traditional and online learning. The study also identiﬁed some
critical factors that affect students’ performance. In addition,
the study investigates the efﬁcacy of various datasets, i.e.,
online vs traditional vs blended for predicting the ﬁnal
performance of students. For analysis, data from 59 students
with 21 variables are collected. In ﬁve datasets of various
weeks, principal component regression (PCR) is used to
estimate the ﬁnal academic success of students. The ﬁndings
reveal that the ﬁnal academic success of students in a merged
calculus course can be estimated by a dataset comprising
data from weeks 1-6 with high accuracy. Moreover, the
study also found that the blended dataset had a higher
predictive performance. The study [22] makes use of several
learning techniques using both tree-based and artiﬁcial neural
network (ANN) models to ﬁnd important factors concerning
university studies. A dataset is gathered for this purpose
that comprises 120 university students. The frequency of
university resources utilization is found to be the most
signiﬁcant factor to impact students’ performance. Similarly,
the number of clicks on university education resources is the
highest impact factor for university students’ performance.
It suggests that interaction with education resources and
educational platforms has higher signiﬁcance.
Making accurate predictions about students’ ﬁnal
grades/success has several associated challenges and data
imbalance is one of the important factors that can inﬂuence
the prediction accuracy. In this regard, [23] compare
various resampling techniques such as borderline syn-
thetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), random
over sampler, SMOTE, SMOTE-edited nearest neighbor
(SMOTE-ENN), SVM-SMOTE, and SMOTE-Tomek to
handle the imbalanced data problems. For performance
comparison, various machine learning classiﬁers including

Rafique - 2021 - Integrating Learning Analytics and Collaborative Learning for Improving Student_s Academic Performan.pdf,"A. Rafiqueet al.: Integrating Learning Analytics and Collaborative Learning for Improving Student’s Academic Performance
RF, KNN, ANN, XG-boost, SVM, DT, LR, and NB are
used. Furthermore, the random hold out and 5-fold cross-
validation methods are used to validate the used models.
Additionally, the results of the Friedman test suggest that the
SVM-SMOTE shows signiﬁcant performance as compared to
other methods. Results indicate that RF outperforms all other
models when trained with the data resampled using SVM-
SMOTE. Similarly, the authors in [24] use an imbalanced
dataset for predicting student performance with SMOTE
oversampling techniques. The study produces clusters with
afﬁnity propagation (AP) SMOTE which are later used for
oversampling. The dataset comprising of 10 features and
2112 instances with an imbalance ratio of 17:85 is used
and the data are resampled using SMOTE and AP SMOTE
with J48 and NB classiﬁers to predict the student at risk.
F measure, G-mean, and areas under the curve (AUC) are
used to evaluate the performance where results show that AP
SMOTE outperforms the original SMOTE for the NB and J48
classiﬁers [1].
The study [25] observes the factors that affect the student’s
performance using statistical analysis techniques. The study
uses a dataset of 400 students collected over a period of two
semesters with the proposed ensemble meta-based tree model
(EMT). Experimental results show that the proposed EMT
gained a high accuracy of 98.5% which is superior compared
to the other techniques. Similarly, [26] obtained data from
141 students in the University of West Scotland using a
student record system, learning management system (LMS),
and survey. The authors compare the classiﬁcation accuracy
of DT, NN, SVM, and an ensemble model. PCA is applied
to identify the appropriate features that should be used
with the models. Seven models are created using different
combinations of variables from different information sources.
The ensemble technique using variables from the three
sources showed the best accuracy of approximately 80%.
The authors make early predictions of students at risk of
low performance in [27]. The study identiﬁes the students
with a high probability to withdraw and highlights important
factors to enhance the performance of students. Furthermore,
the effectiveness of ANN is evaluated using handcrafted
features. The features are derived from virtual learning
environments and are used to predict the risk of students’ poor
performance. Additionally, appropriate remedies to elevate
students’ performance are also introduced. The results show
that the proposed model achieves a classiﬁcation accuracy of
84%–93% and outperforms SVM and LR by 4.3% and 8.6%,
respectively.
The study [28] takes one step ahead and predicts
applicants’ academic performance before admitting them.
A data set of 2,039 students is used to validate the
proposed methodology for the enrolled students in a Saudi
public university. Four prediction models ANN, DT, SVM,
and NB are used to train the model. The results show
that SAT test score which is the pre-admission criterion
makes the most accurate prediction of students’ future
performance.
The author utilizes a deep LSTM model in [29] on a
collection of features obtained from video clickstream data.
The underlying goal is to predict learners’ weekly perfor-
mance and allow teachers to initiate appropriate measures
for timely intervention. The dataset is collected from two
independent MOOC-enabled Computer Science courses and
contains the learners’ interaction logs and assessment grades.
The proposed LSTM model outperforms baseline ANNs,
SVM, and logistic regression with an accuracy score of 93%.
Similarly, study [30] used the RF to predict student dropout in
the self-paced MOOC course. The data was generated from
a self-paced math course offered on the MOOC platform.
The designed model can predict the probability of students’
dropout in the MOOC course, with an accuracy of 87.5%, the
precision of 88%, recall of 87.5%, F1-score of 87.5%, and
AUC of 94.5%.
Along the same lines, the author in [22] used different
automated learning algorithms, including tree-based models
and ANN. The study tested these methods on a group of
120 students who were pursuing a master’s degree in the
virtual learning environment (VLE). The algorithms used
in this study include DT, RF, EGB, and MLP. The best-
performing model is MLP with an average accuracy of 78%
with cross-validation. The ﬁndings suggest that the number
of clicks on the VLE resources, as well as, engagement with
the resources and tasks with the educational platform has
the greatest impact on university students’ performance. The
author uses KNN, LR, SVM, NB, DT, ANN, and ensemble-
based techniques to increase student success in [31]. The data
is obtained from 1491 students from different UAE academic
institutions. Performance is measured using accuracy and
kappa coefﬁcients. Results indicate that a 75% accuracy using
machine learning approaches can be obtained with a Kappa of
0.5 while the ensemble models achieve the precision of 83%.
B. COLLABORATIVE LEARNING
Collaborative learning has gained large attention due to its
potential role in effective learning. Collaborative learning
or group-based learning environment provides several ways
of predicting student performance despite its challenges
and difﬁculties. The authors investigate the challenges
and disputes for effective implementation of collaborative
learning with respect to teachers and students [11], [32]. The
study involves 19 teachers and 23 students from different
disciplines at a Vietnam university and interviews them
using a semi-structured interview method. The participants
are chosen through a snowball sampling technique. The
interview aims at determining the objectives of collaborative
learning, student preparedness for collaboration, the process
of collaborative learning, and learning assessment. The
authors apply a grounded theory approach to analyze the
interviewed data with the help of Nvivo10. Results suggest
that the effectiveness of collaborative learning is affected
by students’ inability to indulge in collaborative learning,
free-riding, competence status, and friendship. Similarly,
three interrelated antecedents are found including ‘teachers
VOLUME 9, 2021 167815","RF, KNN, ANN, XG-boost, SVM, DT, LR, and NB are
used. Furthermore, the random hold out and 5-fold cross-
validation methods are used to validate the used models.
Additionally, the results of the Friedman test suggest that the
SVM-SMOTE shows signiﬁcant performance as compared to
other methods. Results indicate that RF outperforms all other
models when trained with the data resampled using SVM-
SMOTE. Similarly, the authors in [24] use an imbalanced
dataset for predicting student performance with SMOTE
oversampling techniques. The study produces clusters with
afﬁnity propagation (AP) SMOTE which are later used for
oversampling. The dataset comprising of 10 features and
2112 instances with an imbalance ratio of 17:85 is used
and the data are resampled using SMOTE and AP SMOTE
with J48 and NB classiﬁers to predict the student at risk.
F measure, G-mean, and areas under the curve (AUC) are
used to evaluate the performance where results show that AP
SMOTE outperforms the original SMOTE for the NB and J48
classiﬁers [1].
The study [25] observes the factors that affect the student’s
performance using statistical analysis techniques. The study
uses a dataset of 400 students collected over a period of two
semesters with the proposed ensemble meta-based tree model
(EMT). Experimental results show that the proposed EMT
gained a high accuracy of 98.5% which is superior compared
to the other techniques. Similarly, [26] obtained data from
141 students in the University of West Scotland using a
student record system, learning management system (LMS),
and survey. The authors compare the classiﬁcation accuracy
of DT, NN, SVM, and an ensemble model. PCA is applied
to identify the appropriate features that should be used
with the models. Seven models are created using different
combinations of variables from different information sources.
The ensemble technique using variables from the three
sources showed the best accuracy of approximately 80%.
The authors make early predictions of students at risk of
low performance in [27]. The study identiﬁes the students
with a high probability to withdraw and highlights important
factors to enhance the performance of students. Furthermore,
the effectiveness of ANN is evaluated using handcrafted
features. The features are derived from virtual learning
environments and are used to predict the risk of students’ poor
performance. Additionally, appropriate remedies to elevate
students’ performance are also introduced. The results show
that the proposed model achieves a classiﬁcation accuracy of
84%–93% and outperforms SVM and LR by 4.3% and 8.6%,
respectively.
The study [28] takes one step ahead and predicts
applicants’ academic performance before admitting them.
A data set of 2,039 students is used to validate the
proposed methodology for the enrolled students in a Saudi
public university. Four prediction models ANN, DT, SVM,
and NB are used to train the model. The results show
that SAT test score which is the pre-admission criterion
makes the most accurate prediction of students’ future
performance.
The author utilizes a deep LSTM model in [29] on a
collection of features obtained from video clickstream data.
The underlying goal is to predict learners’ weekly perfor-
mance and allow teachers to initiate appropriate measures
for timely intervention. The dataset is collected from two
independent MOOC-enabled Computer Science courses and
contains the learners’ interaction logs and assessment grades.
The proposed LSTM model outperforms baseline ANNs,
SVM, and logistic regression with an accuracy score of 93%.
Similarly, study [30] used the RF to predict student dropout in
the self-paced MOOC course. The data was generated from
a self-paced math course offered on the MOOC platform.
The designed model can predict the probability of students’
dropout in the MOOC course, with an accuracy of 87.5%, the
precision of 88%, recall of 87.5%, F1-score of 87.5%, and
AUC of 94.5%.
Along the same lines, the author in [22] used different
automated learning algorithms, including tree-based models
and ANN. The study tested these methods on a group of
120 students who were pursuing a master’s degree in the
virtual learning environment (VLE). The algorithms used
in this study include DT, RF, EGB, and MLP. The best-
performing model is MLP with an average accuracy of 78%
with cross-validation. The ﬁndings suggest that the number
of clicks on the VLE resources, as well as, engagement with
the resources and tasks with the educational platform has
the greatest impact on university students’ performance. The
author uses KNN, LR, SVM, NB, DT, ANN, and ensemble-
based techniques to increase student success in [31]. The data
is obtained from 1491 students from different UAE academic
institutions. Performance is measured using accuracy and
kappa coefﬁcients. Results indicate that a 75% accuracy using
machine learning approaches can be obtained with a Kappa of
0.5 while the ensemble models achieve the precision of 83%.

set collaborative learning goals’, ‘provided instruction for
collaborative skills’, and ‘assessed student collaboration’.
Similarly, the authors in [33] found indicators based on
students’ interaction and involvement for the assessment of
the individual progress within the framework of teamwork.
The ﬁndings show that the ﬁnal grade depends on the
participation of individuals and the direct relationship across
passive and active associations.
The study [34] performed experiments to test the fea-
sibility of online classes for collaborative learning. With
the data divided into experimental and control groups,
parallelized point-based (PPbA) for massive open online
courses (MOOCs) and parallelized action-based (PAbA) for
the collaborative environment are applied to measure the level
of engagement. Results indicate that both the MOOCs and
interactive environments have higher levels of self-regulation
and interaction with experimental group students. Similarly,
the authors in [35] explored an established collaborative
structure to access the student’s teamwork behaviors, cooper-
ation, common experience, and self-adopted teamwork roles.
To this end, they introduced an automated framework for
guiding in real-time to help educators evaluate coordination
fairly and effectively. The ﬁndings of the study helped to
develop a system for manual interpretation of conversations
on coordination.
Despite several important works in collaborative learning
in general, very little work has been done within the context
of Pakistan.
For instance, the authors in [12] devised a learning
approach to support collective learning methods to uplift the
performance of weak students. The study showed signiﬁcant
variations in the performance of low achievers in their ﬁnal
term exams compared to their mid-term where they achieve
high grades. The ﬁndings suggest that the collaborative learn-
ing engagement of peer group participants is beneﬁcial for
enhancing the learning success of weak students. Similarly,
the authors in [13] evaluated the impact of collaborative
learning on student achievement. The students are divided
into two groups to see the disparity between the two groups
and a post-evaluation is carried out. Different collaborative
learning techniques are used with the experimental group,
including STAD, TGT, and Jigsaw II. Results show that the
experimental group performs better than a control group and
collaborative learning methods have a signiﬁcant effect on
student success.
The inﬂuence of cooperative learning on the academic
performance of Asian students is evaluated in [36]. The
students are divided into ﬁve groups for the analysis. The
ﬁndings of the study reveal that collaborative learning
has a beneﬁcial effect on students’ achievements, as well
as improving participation, school and class engagement,
encouragement, and freedom. Similarly, [37] analyzed the
perceptions of Asian students about collaborative learning
in discussion and group projects. For this purpose, one-
hour face-to-face formal survey interviews of students are
organized. Experimental results show that Asian students

highly appreciate the importance of group work in classrooms
where they can communicate with students from other
cultures, improve learning skills and talents.
The above-discussed research works reveal that pre-
dominantly the work has been done concerning online
learning environments for predicting students’ performance
and timely intervention but very limited work has been
done for traditional learning environments. Therefore, this
research explores various personal and academic information
of students that can help in predicting the performance of
students. Owing to the burden of the teachers, especially
in the context of Pakistan, this study makes use of already
known features of the students to predict their performance
for conventional class environments. Additionally, an efﬁ-
cient and user-friendly tool is developed to help teachers
in deﬁning and managing student groups for collaborative
learning.
III. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK
A web-based software tool named ‘Smart Learning’ is
designed to analyze and improve the learning of students,
as shown in Figure 1. Python’s Django web platform and
SQL Lite3 are used to build the tool. The teachers use it to
determine the progress of their students and act accordingly.
The proposed framework comprises three modules including
a visualization module, a module for group formation and
intervention, and a prediction module.
A. DASHBOARD
Learning dashboard, a class of personal informatics, is a
great tool for analyzing users’ personal traits to enhance self-
knowledge which in turn increases intuition, self-control, and
supporting proper work [38]. Dashboards involve graphical
representations of the present and prospective state of a
learner or a program. Using the data-driven technologies

at an early stage. Instructors can point out and assist
students at risk of academic failure [5]. In ‘Smart Learning’,
teachers can set up a class by inserting subject, course, and
student information. Teachers establish assessment tools for
students such as assignments, quizzes, mid and ﬁnal-term,
and their evaluations. The system dashboard demonstrates the
student’s participation in classes, subject-wise information,
top scorers, and a recent summary of assignments, quizzes,
mid and ﬁnal terms based on grades. A screenshot of the
dashboard of the Smart Learning framework is given in
Figure 2
B. PREDICTION MODULE
The proposed framework incorporates a prediction module
that predicts the ﬁnal outcome of a student with respect to
a particular course in terms of their grades and success or
failure. Several attributes related to student academic and
personal information are used for the prediction module
to predict students’ performance. Similarly, the actual
performance of a student is used such as quizzes, term
grades, and assignments, etc. The prediction module contains
both students’ initially predicted performance and present
performance in the class called actual performance. Initial
performance prediction is carried out at the start of the
semester where the prediction is based on previous academic
and personal information such as good (71-100), average
(50-70), and poor (0-49). Once the grades are predicted,
teachers can make heterogeneous groups for collaborative
learning. Teachers can also establish assessment tools for
students such as assignments, quizzes, mid and ﬁnal terms.
Similarly, the performance of individual students can also be
visualized as shown in Figure 3.
For predicting the performance of the students, two nec-
essary elements are the appropriate data and classiﬁer with
higher accuracy. To obtain higher accuracy both generating
the suitable data and classiﬁer’s ﬁne-tuning is required.
1) DATASET PREPARATION
The main objective of this study is to predict student
performance at the start of the semester and enhance
their performance by ﬁnding factors responsible for poor
performance. For this purpose, data are collected from
ﬁrst-year undergraduate students of the Computer Science
Department of COMSATS University. The primary data are
collected using a questionnaire that includes questions related
to several personal, socio-economic, psychological, and
academic-related variables. The questionnaire is improvised
from several articles related to problem in hand [1], [25],
[27], [39], [40]. After consultation and supervision from
several faculty members, a questionnaire with 34 questions
is ﬁnalized. A total of 164 students participated in the
questionnaires with a response rate of 99% by both females
and males. Table 1 presents the main features of the collected
dataset.
After data gathering, data are prepared to be used for
the machine learning models as it is necessary to clean
and prepare the data to obtain signiﬁcant results from the
classiﬁers [6], [39]. To clean the data from errors, noise,

and irrelevant information, several preprocessing steps are
performed. In addition, the relevance of the attributes is
studied to remove redundant, noisy, or irrelevant features.
In this study, missing values are replaced with the mean value
of the most frequent values for an attribute to mitigate the
loss of information that might be potentially useful. Data
preprocessing is applied based on attributes type. For numeric
features standard scalar is used, for categorical features
binary labeled features label encoder is used but for multi
labeled features one hot encoder is used.
Imbalanced data problem is prevalent in many real-world
datasets and it occurs where the class distributions are highly
different. Studies suggest that machine learning models
work best when the number of instances of each class
is approximately equal [9], [13]. Analyzing the gathered
dataset reveals that they are highly imbalanced with 50%
samples for the ‘Good’ class, 40% for the ‘Average’ class,
and 10% for the ‘Poor’ class. This study uses an adaptive
synthetic (ADASYN) over-sampling approach to resolve
the dataset imbalance problem [41]. It follows the adaptive
generation of minority data samples where more synthetic
data is generated for minority classes to equal the sample
distribution of different classes. The ADASYN method
reduces the learning bias due to imbalanced data distribution
and can adaptively shift the decision boundary. Table 2 shows
the distribution of the dataset after applying the ADASYN
technique.
2) PREDICTION APPROACH
Figure 4 shows the ﬂow of the approach used for pre-
dicting the students’ performance. After data gathering and
preparation, non-contributing features are removed such as
‘Name’, ‘Registration number’, ‘Email’ and ‘Date of birth’,
etc. Also, feature importance is carried out for the most
important predictable feature [12]. For training and testing,
several machine learning models are used and an ensemble
model is proposed as well. For this purpose, KNN, SVM,
LR, RF, MLP, and DT are optimized by ﬁne-tuning their
hyperparameters.
K-NN is a non-parametric technique widely used for
classiﬁcation and regression problems [42]. Based on the
concept of neighbors, an instance is classiﬁed using the
plurality vote of neighbor’s instances. For determining a
neighbor different distance estimation metrics are used such
as Euclidean, Minkowski, and Manhattan distance, etc.
SVM is one of the widely used models for classiﬁcation
and regression problems that works well for many practical
applications [43]. SVM creates hyperplanes to separate
the data into classes. SVM kernels are used to transform
the low-dimensional input space into a high-dimensional
space. By doing so, it can transform a non-separable
problem into a separable problem. DT is one of the popular
techniques used for prediction due to its simplicity and
comprehensibility [39]. With a tree structure, DT has a root
node, edge, and leaf nodes to represent the data. DT can easily

in many real-world applications such as ﬁnancial analysis,
medicine, molecular biology, manufacturing production,
and astronomy. RF is a tree-based ensemble model that
produces highly accurate predictions by combining many
weak learners [5]. RF uses the bagging technique to train
several decision trees using different bootstrap samples to
enhance the performance. However, DT is challenged by the
identiﬁcation of appropriate split criteria that is required at
the root node at each level.
In addition to the above-discussed models, this study
proposes a voting classiﬁer to enhance the prediction
accuracy. The voting classiﬁer is an ensemble model that
combines different base models to make the ﬁnal predictions
as voting classiﬁers tend to show better performance than
individual models [44]–[47]. This study uses SVM, RF, and
K-NN as sub-estimators and ﬁnal predictions are obtained
using both hard and soft voting methods. The hard and soft
voting models can be modeled as follows
KNNp =KNN(data) (1)
SVMp =SVM(data) (2)
and,
RFp =RF(data) (3)
where, KNNp, SVMp, and RFp are the prediction by the KNN,
SVM, and RF models, respectively and these predictions are
used for majority voting. The class prediction with higher
votes will be the ﬁnal class and is decided as

RFp(GC), RFp(AC), RFp(PC) =RF(data) (7)
where, GC, AC, and PC represent the good class, average
class, and poor class, respectively, and KNNp(GC) is the
prediction for good class by the KNN model and similarly
for other models. After ﬁnding the probability by each model
soft voting averages the per-class probabilities as follows:
GCP =KNNp(GC) +SVMp(GC) +RFp(GC)
3 (8)
ACP =KNNp(AC) +SVMp(AC) +RFp(AC)
3 (9)
PCP =KNNp(PC) +SVMp(PC) +RFp(PC)
3 (10)
where, GCP, ACP, andPCP are the probabilities for each
class using each model and soft voting will make the ﬁnal
prediction with the highest probability as follows
Soft Voting =argmaxGCP, ACP, PCP (11)
The soft voting criterion is explained using the following
example. Let the probability scores of each class given by
SVC be, Good =0.812, Average=0.616 & Poor =0.176 and
the RF probability scores against each class be, Good =
0.828, Average =0.594 & Poor =0.359. Similarly, let K-
NN probability scores against each class be, Good =0.964,
Average =0.539 & Poor =0.439 then tee soft voting can be
used in the following way to predict the ﬁnal class.
Goodclass =0.812 +0.828 +0.964
3 =0.868 (12)
Averageclass =0.616 +0.594 +0.539
3 =0.583 (13)
Poorclass =0.176 +0.359 +0.439
3 =0.325 (14)
The soft voting classiﬁes predicts that test example belongs
to the ‘Good’ class. On the other hand, hard voting does
not consider the probability of each class for individual
classiﬁers. Instead, it takes only the predicted class from
the individual classiﬁer and predicts the ﬁnal class on their
voting. Let SVM, RF, and K-NN predict the output class as
‘Good’, ‘Good’, and ‘Average’, respectively, then as per the
hard voting the ﬁnal predicted class would be ‘Good’.
For evaluating the performance of the prediction models,
several evaluation metrics are used such as accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy is the ratio between
the number of correct predictions and the total number
of predicted samples. For accuracy and other metrics, true
positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false
negative (FN) samples are used.
Accuracy = TP +TN
TP +TN +FP +FN (15)
Precision represents the correctness of a classiﬁer. It is the
proportion of correctly classiﬁed positive samples by the total
number of positive predicted samples. A high precision score
means that an algorithm in the actual class is better at making
observations.
Precision = TP
TP +FP (16)
Recall shows the completeness of a classiﬁer. It is often
referred to as sensitivity, which signiﬁes the ability of a
classiﬁer to detect a class properly. The number of true
positives divided by the number of true positives plus the
number of false negatives is known as recall.
Recall = TP
TP +FN (17)
The F1 score, also called the F measure, is the harmonic
mean of precision and recall. F1 score has been regarded as
a better metric to determine the performance of a classiﬁer
especially when there are chances of overﬁtting due to data
imbalance problems.
F1 Score =2 ×Precision ×Recall
Precision +Recall (18)
C. GROUPS FORMATION AND INTERVENTIONS
Collaborative learning is also implemented in the ‘Smart
Learning’ framework. Collaborative learning is a scenario
in which teachers divided the students into groups so
that students’ learning can be improved. Students can
communicate with each other, share their expertise and skills

performance.
Contradictory to the hard voting criteria, the soft voting
criterion does not consider the class with the highest
prediction. Instead, it takes the probability of each class
predicted from each classiﬁer. Probabilities for soft voting
criteria as found as follows
The soft voting criterion is explained using the following
example. Let the probability scores of each class given by
SVC be, Good =0.812, Average=0.616 & Poor =0.176 and
the RF probability scores against each class be, Good =
0.828, Average =0.594 & Poor =0.359. Similarly, let K-
NN probability scores against each class be, Good =0.964,
Average =0.539 & Poor =0.439 then tee soft voting can be
used in the following way to predict the ﬁnal class.
The soft voting classiﬁes predicts that test example belongs
to the ‘Good’ class. On the other hand, hard voting does
not consider the probability of each class for individual
classiﬁers. Instead, it takes only the predicted class from
the individual classiﬁer and predicts the ﬁnal class on their
voting. Let SVM, RF, and K-NN predict the output class as
‘Good’, ‘Good’, and ‘Average’, respectively, then as per the
hard voting the ﬁnal predicted class would be ‘Good’.
For evaluating the performance of the prediction models,

performance indicators of the students serve as the foundation
for grouping the students. On the dashboard, the instructor
can create a Teams and Interventions list. The instructor
prefers a seating plan that involves 3 students. The class’s
time to time seating arrangements are displayed and new
seating plans are added. To enhance the overall team’s and
individual success of the students, instructors can also take
part in the context of the team as per the predictive results.
The instructor can also track the efﬁciency and individual
performance of the team member. Students ‘individual results
are shown in both tabular form and visualization graphs that
include the activities, quiz, session, and ﬁnal-term marks of
the student as shown in Figure 5.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Experiments are performed using a train-test split ratio of
80:20 for training and testing, respectively. All models are
trained and tested on the preprocessed data and the selected
evaluation metrics are used to evaluate the performance of all
models. The formulated research questions are discussed here
to validate the study. Results from all models are discussed in
the perspective of these questions as well.
A. RQ1. WHETHER EXISTING IDENTIFIED FACTORS FOR
PREDICTING STUDENTS’ PERFORMANCE ARE VALID IN
THE LOCAL CONTEXT (PAKISTAN)?
This question determines the validity of factors related to
students’ performance in the local context. This question
is important as the norms, traditions, and culture of one
country vary from the other and so does the education system.
Therefore, it is signiﬁcantly important to determine whether
the existing factors in the literature are applicable and valid in
the context of Pakistan. Classiﬁcation algorithms have been
used to predict students’ performance based on demographic,
pre-university, and institutional factors. Results show that the
factors found in the literature are also valid for the most
part in Pakistan. The data for analysis is collected from
undergraduate students and contains three types of attributes
to predict the performance of students. The ﬁrst type is
demographic that includes gender, age, residence, location,
and father’s qualiﬁcation. The second type is institutional
and has ﬁnal grades, ﬁnancial status, and university distance
attributes. The third type is pre-qualiﬁcation and includes
secondary school grade, higher secondary grade, pre-college,
pre-program, NAT score, and marks of intermediate and
matriculation programs.
In addition to existing factors, several local factors are
used with the existing factors. The input data for classiﬁers
contains previous course marks/grade, grade point average
(GPA), secondary school grade (SSG), higher secondary
school grade (HSSG), gender, and parental status. Table 3
summarizes the attributes of each factor with the corre-
sponding accuracy scores and other evaluation parameters
for our study used models shown in Table 4. Results from
the literature are compared with the proposed classiﬁer,
as well as, other machine learning models used in this

study. The ﬁndings show that the identiﬁed factors used
for grade prediction are comparable with the local factors.
Experimental results indicate that ‘previous grade’, ‘internal
marks’ and HSSC grades are found to be effective for grade
prediction.
B. RQ2. WHICH ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES
THAT HELP ACCURATE PREDICTION OF STUDENT’S
PERFORMANCE?
The second question determines important features to make
accurate predictions of students’ performance. For this
purpose, a deep understanding of the factors, as well as,
features is required. To this end, study [41] conducted a
survey of 357 papers related to students’ performance with
respect to 29 features. These features fall under the banners
of course and pre-course performance, student engagement,
student demographics, high school performance, and psycho-
motor skills. Findings show that the degree dropout rate
is mainly inﬂuenced by student motivation, habits, social
and ﬁnancial issues, lack of progress, pre-qualiﬁcation,
institutional, admission test score, and career transition.
This study makes deeper and explorative analysis s to
examine and determine the key factors responsible for
students’ performance. The objective is to understand the
factors that might be used in obtaining the key strengths and
weaknesses for obtaining students’ better performance.
Figure 6 shows the importance of all the features of the data
set. It can be observed that features such as residential area,
NAT marks, time spent for sports and mobile usage, previous
degree grades and father occupation, etc. are more important
than gender, parental and job status, etc. This solidiﬁes our
observation that most students’ grades are affected by student
involvement in the class. These factors are important because
results show that those students perform signiﬁcantly better
who have good marks in admission tests and previous degrees
than those who do not participate in such activities.
C. RQ3. IS IT POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE
OF A STUDENT BY COLLABORATIVE LEARNING?
The third question of this research evaluates the efﬁcacy of
collaborative learning to boost the performance of students.
This research uses the concept of the control group and
experiment group for this purpose. The study uses the
impact of collaborative learning on students’ academic
achievement over speciﬁed periods of time and the variance
across experimental and control groups is studied. After
exposing the experimental group to collaborative learning
while providing traditional study to the controlled group the
post-test is administered. The pre-test and post-test are used
to analyze the academic achievement of the control group and
experimental group, respectively.
For handling the potential pre-existing differences con-
cerning students’ ability in the experimental and control
groups, a pre-test is conducted. Later, these scores are
used to divide the students into groups. This study uses
teacher-selected groups for collaborative learning. For a fair
comparison, the effect of teacher quality on the groups is
controlled by using the same instructor and the same course
contents. The activities for the experiment and control groups
are however different where the former followed learning
activities in small heterogeneous groups while the latter
follows the traditional teaching method. The contents are

First, we analyze the performance of the experimental
group before and after the treatment. For experiments, the
experiment group has a total of 24 students. Table 5 shows
the percentage score of performance prediction by the ‘Smart
Learning’ system.
We have 75% students for the ‘Good’ class, 21% for the
‘Average’ class, and 4% for the ‘Poor’ class of students before
the treatment for the experiment group. Results show that

the ratio of good performance students is the highest in the

Now, the teacher divides the experimental group students
into 8 sub-groups, each with 3 students. A large number
of activities are performed such as assignments, quizzes,
sessions, and projects performed by teachers in groups.
Teachers observe the performance of both individuals and
groups from time to time. Appropriate and necessary
interventions are made by the teachers accordingly. After
the term ends, the performance of the subgroups in the
experiment group is analyzed again to see the change in
students’ performance. Results of students’ performance for
pre-assessment and post-assessment are given in Figure 8.
Results show that the performance of the students in the
experiment group has been improved after the treatment.
Currently, 79 % of the total students fall under the ‘Good’
class which was 75% before the treatment. Similarly, the

percentage of the students in the ‘Average’ class has been
reduced to 13% from 21%. However, the ratio of ‘Poor’
class students has been slightly increased but this ratio is
not substantial as compared to the ratio of the students who
improved their performance.
After receiving the treatment, the achievement scores of
both groups have a signiﬁcant difference. Results show that
the experimental group after treatment is performing better
than before the treatment. It is so because the students took
part in each class activity, prepared and submitted their tasks
and so perform much better than control groups. Overall,
we can say that the collaborative learning method has a
signiﬁcant effect on student success, and thus it can enhance
the learning ability of students.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The relevance and importance of big data analytics and
collaborative learning have been proven by several research
works, however, its validity and efﬁcacy vary from one
locality to another due to demographic, institutional, and
personal attributes. This study is designed with twofold
objectives; building a user-friendly and efﬁcient system to
predict students’ performance and adopting proper corrective
measures to elevate their learning, and investigating the
potential and scope of collaborative learning in the context of
Pakistan. An extensive literature review is performed to ﬁnd
the appropriate factors for predicting students’ performance.
A system, called Smart Learning, is built where the instructor
can predict, and track the students’ performance, utilize
collaborative learning and analyze the results. For prediction,
besides the well-known machine learning models, an ensem-
ble model is proposed which shows better performance
than state-of-the-art approaches. Three research questions
are formulated to meet the objective of this study. For
the ﬁrst research question, results show that the existing
identiﬁed factors for students’ performance prediction are
valid to a large extent in the local context of Pakistan
as well. With respect to the most important features (2nd
research question), experiments reveal that demographic, pre-
university, and institutional factors (NTS marks, and previous
degrees marks, etc.) are the most appropriate factors to
predict students’ ﬁnal performance. For research question 3,
experiments are performed with experiment and control
groups to analyze the impact of collaborative learning on
improving students’ performance. With a teacher-selected
group strategy, students in the experiment group are given
several tasks, their performance is monitored over time, and
students are regrouped if needed. Results suggest that by
using collaborative learning, the student’s learning capability
can be elevated substantially. This study conﬁrms that
classroom-based collaborative learning techniques are found
to be more effective than traditional learning methods. The
study is not without limitations. The dataset collected for
experiments is relatively small, and a large dataset can
provide more conclusive results. We intend to predict teacher
performance as well and build a course recommender system
for students in the future.
