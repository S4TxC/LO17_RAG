Abstract
Academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and grit (i.e., perseverance of effort and consist-
ency of interests) have all separately shown to predict academic success within tra-
ditional education. In higher online education, information on these relationships is 
lacking, while this group of learners is growing in size and importance. We therefore 
investigated the total as well as the unique predictive value of academic self-efficacy, 
self-esteem, and grit on academic success in higher online education. Moreover, 
mediation effects were investigated. Students of a higher online education univer -
sity in the Netherlands participated (N = 2027, age 18–80 years) in this observational 
study. Participants filled out online questionnaires on the variables of interest and 
potential confounding variables at baseline. Academic success was measured objec-
tively through information provided by the exam registration office and operational-
ized in three variables: exam attempt, study progress, and academic performance. 
Logistic regression analyses showed that consistency of interests significantly pre-
dicted exam attempt (B = .43, p < .001). Generalized multiple linear regression anal-
yses with negative binomial distribution showed that consistency of interests was 
a significant predictor of study progress (B = .16, p < .001). Mixed model analyses 
revealed no significant predictors for academic performance (ps > .06). The fact that 
of our three predictors solely consistency of interests was found to be predictive for 
academic success indicates that online educational institutes should pay attention to 
consistency of interests of their students to improve the academic success rates.

1 Introduction
To keep up with the fast-changing society, it is important to continue learning 
during the life span. Online education plays an important role in life-long educa-
tion for adults (Schlosser & Simonson, 2010). This student population is often 
characterized by combining a part-time or full-time job, family responsibilities, 
and social life, resulting in a busy life (Eurydice, 2011). By means of online edu-
cation, they can choose their own pace and place to study. A prevalent problem 
within higher education, and particularly in online education, is the low retention 
(i.e., continuing enrolment in the educational program) and, consequently, high 
dropout rate (Berge & Huang, 2004; Yukselturk et al., 2014). To increase reten-
tion and decrease dropout rates, it is important to investigate which factors play 
a role in students’ participation in online education, in sustaining their studies 
and in achieving academic success. Beyond the impact of cognitive factors (e.g., 
content knowledge, executive functions), research has shown the critical impor -
tance of non-cognitive factors (i.e., behaviours, skills, attitudes, and strategies) 
for achieving academic success (Farrington et al., 2012).
There is a wealth of evidence showing that motivation and beliefs about one’s 
own competence and expectancy of success are important ingredients for achiev -
ing academic success (Eccles & Wigfield, 2002). Students’ expectancy of suc-
cess motivates them to study and learn from the study material, which affects 
academic success (Wigfield, 1994). Academic self-efficacy is such an expectancy 
belief-factor shown to predict academic success (Asakereh & Yousofi, 2018; 
Honicke & Broadbent, 2016; Robbins et al., 2004). It is defined as believing in 
one’s ability to successfully perform/carry out a given task or to gain academic 
success (Bandura, 1977; Duncan & McKeachie, 2005). Another factor that helps 
students to remain motivated in their studies is grit. Grit can be defined as being 
perseverant and having passion for attaining long-term goals (Duckworth et al., 
2007). Several studies found a positive link between grit and academic success 
(Credé et al., 2017; Duckworth et al., 2007), which led to schools incorporating 
it into their curriculum (Kirchgasler, 2018). Additionally, research has shown that 
self-esteem has a major positive impact on the motivation for students to strive 
for achieving their academic goals (Baumeister et al., 2003).
Most studies focussed on the impact of either academic self-efficacy, self-
esteem, or grit on academic success separately, and, to our knowledge, these pre-
dictors have never been combined in one single study. It is not clear yet which fac-
tor is most important in predicting academic success. In addition, it is not known 
how the factors potentially overlap in predicting academic success. Moreover, 
most studies have been conducted among children, adolescents, and traditional 
college students (e.g., Asakereh & Yousofi, 2018; Credé et  al., 2017; Honicke 
& Broadbent, 2016), while research in higher online education is limited (e.g., 
Hwang et  al., 2017; Radovan, 2011). Furthermore, the question arises whether 
academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and grit uniquely contribute to academic suc-
cess directly, or whether the relationship between grit and academic success is 
an indirect relationship mediated by either academic self-efficacy or self-esteem","1 Introduction

Academic self‑efficacy, self‑esteem, and grit in higher online…
(Usher et al., 2019; Wolters & Hussain, 2015). The present study was conducted 
to investigate (1) the total predictive value of academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, 
and grit on academic success, (2) the unique predictive values of academic self-
efficacy, self-esteem, and grit respectively on academic success, and (3) whether 
the relationship between grit and academic success is mediated by either aca-
demic self-efficacy or self-esteem in higher online education.
1.1  Academic success in higher online education
Being able to adapt to the fast-changing technology and society, it is important to 
be able to keep on learning through the life span (Cedefop, 2010). In 2015, approxi-
mately 10% of adults between 25 and 64 years participated in formal higher online 
education (Eurostat, 2016). These adult students typically enrol in college or univer -
sity after a delay in their studies, study part-time, and often struggle with combin-
ing their studies with a busy family and career life (Eurydice, 2011). Many students 
have already obtained some sort of a higher education degree, and are studying for 
self-improvement or career advancement. This is in contrast to traditional, campus-
based college students, who typically enrol in college or university directly after 
completing high school, study full time, and are still dependent on the financial 
support of their parents or on scholarships, or work part-time to finance their stud-
ies (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics  2002). 
Their core focus is on studying, which will enable them to start their career life. For 
adult students, it is often impossible to attend classes (either part-time or full-time) 
or study/attend those classes at fixed times. Online education could be a solution 
as students can study from their own home, often at their own chosen pace and on 
their own time schedule. A specific type of online education—individualised, higher 
online education—takes place temporally synchronously (e.g., virtual classes) or 
asynchronously (e.g., e-mail contact, assignments, pre-recorded video), and students 
and teachers are physically at different locations (Schlosser & Simonson, 2010).
A common problem in higher education, but especially in higher online educa-
tion, is the high dropout rate (Berge & Huang, 2004; Yukselturk et al., 2014). Find-
ing out which cognitive and non-cognitive factors determine whether students sus-
tain in their studies and achieve academic success has been is the focus of many 
researchers for many years (see Hattie, 2009, for a synthesis on 800 meta-analyses 
about influences on student achievement). In the present study, three of the most 
investigated non-cognitive factors are studied with academic success: academic self-
efficacy, self-esteem, and grit.
1.2  Academic self‑efficacy
Bandura (1982) defined self-efficacy as “judgments of how well one can execute 
courses of action required to deal with prospective situations” (p. 122). Research 
has shown that self-efficacy is a very important contributor to academic success 
(Alivernini & Lucidi, 2011; Muenks et al., 2017; Stajkovic et al., 2018; Yip, 2012). 
Within an academic setting, self-efficacy is mostly referred to as one’s confidence","The present study was conducted

in having the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform well in a specific 
course or on a specific task, which is often called academic self-efficacy, perfor -
mance self-efficacy, or self-efficacy for learning and performance (Duncan & McK -
eachie, 2005). Academic self-efficacy is considered as a course and task-specific 
construct.
Most studies that investigated the relationship between academic self-efficacy and 
academic success found significant positive relationships (for a systematic review, 
see Honicke & Broadbent, 2016) for traditional college students (Cassady, 2004; 
Diseth, 2011; Fenning & May, 2013; Stajkovic et  al., 2018) as well as for online 
students (de Fátima Goulão, 2014; Ergul, 2004; Joo et al., 2013; Radovan, 2011). 
In their meta-analysis, Robbins et al. (2004) found that academic self-efficacy was 
moderately related to retention with a mean true-score correlation of ρ = .359, and 
moderately to strongly related to GPA (ρ = .496). These results suggest that aca-
demic self-efficacy plays an important role in predicting academic success. Aca-
demic success is mostly measured as grades or GPA. The question remains how 
academic self-efficacy is related to exam attempt, study progress, and academic per-
formance in higher online education.
1.3  Self‑esteem
Self-esteem can be defined as an individual’s evaluation or general feelings regard-
ing the self (Rosenberg et al., 1995). While academic self-efficacy is considered as 
domain or task-specific and focused on how well one believes to perform on a spe-
cific task or assignment, self-esteem is a global construct, focused on the self and 
feelings of self-worth in general.
Within traditional education, the relationship between self-esteem and academic 
success has been widely explored. Still, findings are inconsistent across studies. For 
instance, Booth and Gerard (2011) found a moderately positive association between 
self-esteem and several academic achievement scores. While this moderately posi-
tive association has been confirmed in a recent meta-analysis (Körük, 2017), Lack -
ner (2015) only found a weak positive correlation in her meta-analysis. Other studies 
found only an indirect association between self-esteem and academic achievement 
(Di Giunta et al., 2013), or no effect at all (Trautwein et al., 2006). These results 
show that it is still unclear how self-esteem is related to academic success, mak -
ing further research necessary. Moreover, these studies have been conducted among 
children, adolescents, and college students. To our knowledge, research on the asso-
ciation between self-esteem and academic success for higher online education stu-
dents is lacking. Furthermore, it is not known whether self-esteem predicts all three 
aspects of academic success (i.e., exam attempt, study progress, and academic per -
formance) in the same way.
1.4  Grit
Grit, defined as “trait-level perseverance and passion for long-term goals” (Duck -
worth et  al., 2007, p. 1087) has been a hot topic of research over the last decade","in having the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform well in a specific

Academic self‑efficacy, self‑esteem, and grit in higher online…
(e.g., Cross, 2014; Kelly et al., 2014; Reed & Jeremiah, 2017). Grit entails two fac-
ets: perseverance of effort and consistency of interests (Duckworth & Quinn, 2009; 
Duckworth et al., 2007). Both facets are about long-term endurance, in which per -
severance of effort is focussed on persisting even when facing obstacles and failure, 
while consistency of interests is focussed on the sustainability of long-term goals.
Grit has demonstrated to be an empirically relevant predictor for several aca-
demic success variables for high school and college students, for example, grade 
point average (GPA; Credé et al., 2017; Duckworth & Quinn, 2009; Hwang et al., 
2017), retention (Cross, 2013; Duckworth et al., 2007; Saunders-Scott et al., 2018), 
and intent to persist in college (Bowman et al., 2015). Although the strength of the 
relationship between grit and academic success varies among studies, the found 
relationships are mostly positive (for a meta-analysis, see Credé et al., 2017; for a 
systematic review, see Christopoulou et al., 2018). Studies that made a distinction 
between perseverance of effort and consistency of interests mostly only found a 
positive relationship between perseverance of effort and academic success, and not 
between consistency of interests and academic success (e.g., Bowman et al., 2015; 
Datu et al., 2016). In some studies, only indirect relationships were found, in which 
perseverance of effort in relation to academic success was mediated by self-regula-
tion (Wolters & Hussain, 2015), academic self-efficacy (Usher et al., 2019), or con-
scientiousness (MacCann & Roberts, 2010; Rimfeld et al., 2016).
In higher online education, to our knowledge, two studies investigated the rela-
tionship between grit and academic success. The study of Hwang et al. (2017) which 
was conducted at the Korean Open University showed that the perseverance of effort 
subscale of grit was related to academic success, but only indirectly: this relation-
ship was mediated by academic maladjustment. Furthermore, they did not find a 
relationship between the grit facet consistency of interests and academic success. 
Notably, their sample existed only of female students. Why they chose to exclude 
male students is not clear. Furthermore, in the study of Cross (2013), participants 
were non-traditional doctoral students (i.e., comparable to higher online students in 
age and life circumstances). This study showed that grit, measured as one overall 
score, was a significant positive predictor of academic success, but only for females: 
the relationship for male students was not significant. All in all, research on grit and 
academic success in higher online education is limited.
1.5  Academic self‑efficacy, self‑esteem, grit, and academic success
In 1977, Bandura made clear that self-efficacy is in a way related to perseverance 
(i.e., one of the facets of grit), and stated that “efficacy expectations determine 
how much effort people will expend and how long they will persist in the face of 
obstacles and aversive experiences” (p. 194). A few studies have investigated the 
relationship between academic self-efficacy, grit, and academic success. Muenks 
et al. (2018) found that both academic self-efficacy and the grit scale perseverance 
of effort predicted academic performance uniquely. However, Wolters and Hussain 
(2015) found that the relationship between grit and academic performance for col-
lege students disappeared after adding academic self-efficacy, which suggests that","Grit entails two fac-

academic self-efficacy might act as a mediator between grit and academic perfor -
mance. Usher et al. (2019) investigated two pathways: whether academic self-effi-
cacy acted as a mediator between grit and academic performance, and whether grit 
acted as a mediator between academic self-efficacy and performance. They found 
the most compelling evidence for academic self-efficacy as mediator, and argued 
that grittier students will only perform better in school when they perceive them-
selves as capable (Usher et al., 2019).
The relationship between academic self-efficacy and self-esteem and how they 
predict academic success when combined has been explored in a few studies within 
traditional education. For instance, Lane et al. (2004) found that academic self-effi-
cacy was a significant predictor of performance, but that self-esteem was not when 
they were jointly included in the analysis. However, Gębka (2014), as well as Phan 
(2010), showed in their studies that neither self-esteem nor academic self-efficacy 
significantly predicted performance when simultaneously included in the model. It 
is still not clear how academic self-efficacy and self-esteem combined predict aca-
demic success. Furthermore, data on this relationship for higher online education is 
lacking.
To our knowledge, Weisskirch (2018) is the only study that explored the rela-
tionship between grit and self-esteem with academic performance. Weisskirch 
(2018) found that for undergraduate students, perseverance of effort as well as self-
esteem predicted the subjectively estimated grade, but not the actual achieved final 
grade. He also showed that self-esteem was positively correlated with both of the 
grit scales. However, the potential mediating role of self-esteem in the relationship 
between grit and academic success has not been explored. Still, self-esteem has 
shown to mediate the relationship between grit and life satisfaction (Li et al., 2018). 
In this line of reasoning, people high in grit are able to persist when things get dif-
ficult, and are consistent in their interests on the long term, which could give them 
a positive boost in their self-evaluation (i.e., self-esteem), which in turn could foster 
their academic success. In contrast, people who are low in grit, who are not able to 
persist and adhere to their interests or goals for the long run, might evaluate them-
selves as inadequate, which could in turn hinder their academic success. Further -
more, it remains unclear how academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and grit together 
predict academic success in higher online education, and what the remaining unique 
predicting value is after controlling for each other.
1.6  Possible confounders
To investigate the relationships in question, it is important to preclude possible spu-
rious relations by controlling for possible confounders. One of those possible con-
founders is age. For instance, Credé et al. (2017) showed in their meta-analysis that 
grit scores increase with age. Moreover, self-esteem seems to change with age, with 
an increase from adolescence until the age of 60 years, and a decline after that (Orth 
et  al., 2015). Furthermore, age was related to several academic success variables 
before (Clifton et al., 2008; Lee & Choi, 2011; Richardson et al., 2012).","academic self-efficacy might act as a mediator between grit and academic perfor -
mance. Usher et al. (2019) investigated two pathways: whether academic self-effi-
cacy acted as a mediator between grit and academic performance, and whether grit 
acted as a mediator between academic self-efficacy and performance. They found 
the most compelling evidence for academic self-efficacy as mediator, and argued 
that grittier students will only perform better in school when they perceive them-
selves as capable (Usher et al., 2019).
The relationship between academic self-efficacy and self-esteem and how they 
predict academic success when combined has been explored in a few studies within 
traditional education. For instance, Lane et al. (2004) found that academic self-effi-
cacy was a significant predictor of performance, but that self-esteem was not when 
they were jointly included in the analysis. However, Gębka (2014), as well as Phan 
(2010), showed in their studies that neither self-esteem nor academic self-efficacy 
significantly predicted performance when simultaneously included in the model. It 
is still not clear how academic self-efficacy and self-esteem combined predict aca-
demic success. Furthermore, data on this relationship for higher online education is 
lacking.

Another potential confounder is gender. It is shown that overall, males score 
higher on academic self-efficacy (Huang, 2013) and self-esteem (Di Giunta et al., 
2013), and lower on grit (Kannangara et  al., 2018) than females. Furthermore, 
females tend to score higher on academic performance than males (Duckworth & 
Seligman, 2006; Richardson et al., 2012; Robbins et al., 2004). Thus, these two vari-
ables are taken into account as covariates in the present study.
1.7  Present study
The present study looks at the relationship of academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, 
and grit with academic success in higher online education. The aim was three-fold: 
to investigate (1) the total predictive value of academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, 
and grit (i.e., measured as two subscales: perseverance of effort and consistency 
of interests) on exam attempt, study progress, and academic performance respec-
tively, (2) the unique predictive values of academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and 
grit respectively on each of the three academic success aspects, and (3) whether 
academic self-efficacy and/or self-esteem mediate the relationship between grit and 
each of the three academic success aspects. Furthermore, it investigated the extent to 
which the predictors are different concepts by exploring the overlap between them.

2.1  Design
The study is part of the ALOUD study, in which in total 2040 students took part. In 
this observational longitudinal study, several biological and psychological determi-
nants of academic performance in higher online education were investigated. For 
detailed information regarding the design, see Neroni et  al. (2015). The ALOUD 
study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the higher online education univer -
sity and all participants gave their informed consent in advance of the study.
2.2  Setting
All data were collected from students participating in higher online education in the 
Netherlands. The only requirement for admission to this university is a minimum age 
of 18 years (i.e., no prior diplomas are required). The educational programme of this 
university consisted of seven educational bachelor and six master programs: Law, 
Management Science, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Cultural Science, 
Learning Sciences (only a master program), and Psychology. Until September 2014, 
students could enrol in one or more individual courses separately, or in a full-length 
degree program, and could choose from nearly 300 courses. A course consisted of 
one or more study modules, each corresponding to 4.3 European Credits (ECs; i.e., 
120 h of studying). Students could enrol in a course at any moment and were able","Another potential confounder is gender. It is shown that overall, males score

to choose their own pace of study during a period of 14 months at which time the 
enrolment (i.e., the right to take an exam and receive the ECs) was terminated.
Researchers studying academic success at traditional colleges and universities 
mostly focused on academic achievement and school performance, measured by 
grades, grade point average (GPA), previous GPA, or retention rates (i.e., continu-
ing enrolment in the educational programme). However, in higher online education, 
academic success is not as easily defined or measured. For instance, at the institution 
where the present study was carried out, students were allowed to enrol in either one 
or more courses or could choose for a full degree programme. The students were 
allowed to start their courses whenever they wanted and could determine their own 
study pace within a 14-month period. Furthermore, registering for another course 
within the 14-month period lengthened the study period for the former courses. For 
example, take a student enrolled in course A on January 1, 2013. Initially, the stu-
dent had 14 months to finish the course, i.e., until February 28, 2014. However, if 
this student enrolled in a second course, course B, on July 1, 2013 (i.e., enrolment 
in course B occurred within the 14-month period of course A), the allowed study 
period for course A was lengthened to the finish date of course B, which is August 
31, 2014. Another example is that some students are only enrolled in a course 
for personal or career related development, without the intention to take an exam 
attempt. These examples show that it is hard to define academic success in terms of 
a singular outcome variable.
2.3  Participants
Participants were all students from a higher online education university in the Neth-
erlands. Students (N = 4945) who started studying at this university for the first time 
between August 6th, 2012 and August 5th, 2013 were invited to participate in the 
ALOUD study. In total, 2,040 students (57.5%) fully participated at baseline (780 
males, 1260 females;  Mage = 36.7 years, age range: 18–80 years).
2.4  Procedure
Students who registered for a course for the very first time between the 6th of 
August 2012 and the 5th of August 2013 were invited by e-mail to participate in the 
ALOUD study. Participants were asked to fill out an online questionnaire, which 
took approximately 45 min to complete. Before starting the questionnaire, they had 
to tick a box to provide informed consent. It was allowed to pause the question-
naire and continue at a later time. Non-completers and non-responders received 
a reminder after 2 weeks and a last reminder after 1 more week via e-mail. Non-
completers and non-responders were approached by phone 1  week after the last 
reminder. As an incentive, gift coupons of 20 euros were allotted, with a winning 
chance of 5%. In addition, after 14 months, the exam database of the university was 
utilised for data extraction on the examination grades of the participants. The period 
of 14  months was chosen because this is the standard subscription period when","to choose their own pace of study during a period of 14 months at which time the

the ALOUD study, see Neroni et al. (2015).
2.5  Measurements
2.5.1  Independent variable measures
To measure academic self-efficacy, the Self-Efficacy for Learning and Performance 
scale, a subscale of the MSLQ-A (Pintrich et  al., 1993) was used. This subscale 
consists of 8 items (e.g., I’m confident I can learn the basic concepts taught in this 
course) measured on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 7 (totally 
agree). As students were able to follow several courses at once, students were asked 
to answer these items for one of the courses they were about to start or just started. 
One overall mean score for academic self-efficacy was calculated. Pintrich et  al., 
(1993) reported a Cronbach’s alpha of .93.
Self-esteem was measured with the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 
1965). This scale consists of 10 items (e.g., I am able to do things as well as most 
other people) measured on a 4-point scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 
(strongly agree). Five items were negatively worded and therefore reversed scored. 
One mean score was computed, with a higher score reflecting higher self-esteem. 
Fleming and Courtney (1984) reported a Cronbach’s alpha of .88.
Grit was measured with the Grit Scale (Duckworth & Quinn, 2009). This instru-
ment consists of two subscales with six items each: (1) Perseverance of effort (e.g., 
Setbacks don’t discourage me), and (2) Consistency of interests (e.g., My interests 
change from year to year). All items were answered on a 5-point scale, ranging from 
1  (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). After recoding six reversed-scored items, 
mean scores per subscale were calculated, with higher scores reflecting more perse-
verance of effort and consistency of interests. Duckworth and Quinn (2009) reported 
Cronbach’s alphas of .70 and .77 for perseverance of effort and consistency of inter -
ests, respectively.
2.5.2  Dependent variable measures
Academic success was operationalized in three ways. The first outcome variable was 
exam attempt, which was defined as continued enrolment in the educational program 
measured by at least one exam attempt in the 14-month period for any course they 
were enrolled in. Reasons for not taking an exam attempt could vary greatly (e.g., 
having test anxiety, not having the original goal to take an exam but just registering 
for the course out of interest or to master knowledge, or the course being harder or 
less interesting than expected), which makes it hard to make a statement on whether 
these students did or did not drop out. However, it was presumed that participants 
taking an exam attempt within 14 months retained studying.
The second measure was study progress, which is a sum of the number of 
completed modules after 14 months. A course that students were enrolled in con-
sisted of one or more modules, with each module corresponding to 4.3 European","registering for a course. For full details on the content, as well as the procedure of 
the ALOUD study, see Neroni et al. (2015).

Credits (ECs; i.e., 120 h of study load). As the study progress for students with-
out an exam attempt is zero, and because it is unclear whether students without an 
exam attempt did or did not study, students with no exam attempt were excluded 
from the analyses with the outcome variable study progress.
The third measure was academic performance, in which students’ grades were 
compared. Sufficient as well as insufficient grades were included. Because of the 
complexity of the educational system in higher online education mentioned in the 
introduction, taking the average of the courses per student would give a distorted 
view, as some students only took one course within the 14-month period, whereas 
others might have studied several courses at the same time. Therefore, academic 
performance was calculated as grade per course nested within students. To calcu-
late performance scores, courses with only a pass/fail exam were excluded from 
the analyses with the outcome variable academic performance. A flowchart with 
the number of participants per outcome measure is displayed in Fig. 1 .

2.6  Statistical analyses
Analyses were conducted using SPSS (Version 25.0). First, descriptive statistics were 
given with means and standard deviations for the continuous variables, and counts and 
percentages for categorical variables. Second, correlation analyses were conducted to 
investigate how the covariates and predictor variables were related, and tests for multi-
collinearity were conducted. Third, as the outcome measure exam attempt is a dichoto-
mous variable, a hierarchical logistic regression analysis was conducted with all the 
predictor variables together in one model, to analyse the total predictive value of the 
predictors as well as the unique predictive value of each of the predictors. Fourth, a 
generalized multiple linear regression analysis with a negative binomial distribution 
was conducted within the subgroup of participants who did an exam attempt, to test 
whether academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and grit predicted study progress, oper-
ationalized as the number of credit points gained after 14  months of studying. This 
analysis was used because the data was highly positively skewed and over-dispersed. 
Fifth, a mixed model regression analysis was conducted to investigate the total predic-
tive value as well as the unique predictive value of academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, 
and grit respectively on academic performance (i.e., course grades). As students were 
free in the number of courses they enrolled in during the study period of 14 months, 
the analysis was not run with an average of all exam grades, but with a mixed model 
regression with courses nested under students. In this way, the correlation of course 
grades for different courses within an individual was taken into account. The final 
model for this analysis was constructed using the following steps: (1) A null model was 
built with only a fixed intercept, ignoring the hierarchical structure; (2) Covariates as 
fixed variables were added; (3) Predictors as fixed variables were added; (4) Random 
intercepts were added; (5) Random slopes were added. Each next step was only taken 
if the previous step was found to improve the model significantly, which was tested 
with a chi-square model comparison. Sixth, mediation effects were considered follow-
ing the approach recommended by Kenny et al. (1998): (1) grit being the predictor and 
academic self-efficacy being the mediator, with all covariates taken into account, for 
each of the three outcome variables; and (2) grit being the predictor and self-esteem 
being the mediator, with all covariates taken into account, for each of the three outcome 
variables. Prior to the mediation analyses, bivariate analyses were conducted. This is 
necessary as a mediation analysis is only useful when (1) the predictor is significantly 
related to the outcome; (2) the predictor is significantly related to the mediator; and (3) 
the mediator is significantly related to the outcome (Kenny et al., 1998). If one of these 
three steps is not met, a mediation effect is not possible and will not be analysed.

regression with courses nested under students. In this way, the correlation of course 
grades for different courses within an individual was taken into account. The final 
model for this analysis was constructed using the following steps: (1) A null model was 
built with only a fixed intercept, ignoring the hierarchical structure; (2) Covariates as 
fixed variables were added; (3) Predictors as fixed variables were added; (4) Random 
intercepts were added; (5) Random slopes were added. Each next step was only taken 
if the previous step was found to improve the model significantly, which was tested 
with a chi-square model comparison. Sixth, mediation effects were considered follow-
ing the approach recommended by Kenny et al. (1998): (1) grit being the predictor and 
academic self-efficacy being the mediator, with all covariates taken into account, for 
each of the three outcome variables; and (2) grit being the predictor and self-esteem 
being the mediator, with all covariates taken into account, for each of the three outcome 
variables. Prior to the mediation analyses, bivariate analyses were conducted. This is 
necessary as a mediation analysis is only useful when (1) the predictor is significantly 
related to the outcome; (2) the predictor is significantly related to the mediator; and (3) 
the mediator is significantly related to the outcome. If one of these 
three steps is not met, a mediation effect is not possible and will not be analysed.

3.1  Descriptive statistics
An overview of the descriptive information on the relevant variables of the present 
study as well as internal consistency values of the independent variables are given in 
Tables 1 and 2 for n = 2027 and n = 1128 respectively. An independent samples t test"

revealed a significant difference between the two samples for age, t(3153) = 2.44, 
p = .02. The effect size Cohen’s d was calculated to interpret the effect size of the 
t test, d = .09. According to Cohen (1998), values between .20 and .50 are consid-
ered as a small effect, between .50 and .80 as a moderate effect, and above .80 as a 
large effect, which means that the mean difference of age between the two samples 
is trivial.
For Perseverance of effort, the internal consistency value is rather low (i.e., 
α = .67). Therefore, item-total correlations were taken into account, which should 
be ≥ .30 (Field, 2009). For this subscale, item-total correlations ranged from .30 
to .48, which justified to include the Perseverance of effort subscale in the main 
analyses.
3.2  Correlations
Table 3 shows the relationships between the predictor variables and the covariates. 
All predictor variables are significantly correlated with each other, with correlations 
ranging from .06 to .38. According to Cohen (1992), effect sizes of Pearson’s cor -
relations with values between .10 and .30 are classified as small, between .30 and 
.50 as moderate, and between .50 and .70 as large. Values lower than .10 are neg-
ligibly small and therefore, considered trivial, even if the correlation is significant. 
Therefore, only significant effect sizes of .10 and above were interpreted as being 
meaningful.

Performance of effort, consistency of interests, and self-esteem were positively 
associated with age. Age was negatively associated to exam attempt, indicating that 
taking an exam attempt decreased with age. Age was positively associated with aca-
demic performance, suggesting that older students receive higher exam grades than 
younger students. Females obtained higher scores for perseverance of effort as well

self-efficacy. Collinearity diagnostics showed that multicollinearity was no concern, 
with VIF scores ranging from 1.12 to 1.29, indicating that the predictors are all sep-
arate constructs.
3.3  Predicting exam attempt
A hierarchical logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the total pre-
dictive value of academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and grit on exam attempt as dis-
played in Table 4. A test of the covariates model (i.e., model A) compared to the null 
model was significant, indicating that the covariates age and gender together distin-
guished between doing and not doing an exam attempt, χ 2 (2, n = 2027) = 36.16, 
p < .001. However, only age made a significant unique contribution to the predic-
tion of exam attempt, Wald χ2 = 34.58, p < .001. Next, by adding the predictor vari-
ables academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, perseverance of effort, and consistency 
of interests, the model significantly improved, χ2
diff (4, n = 2027) = 41.27, p < .001. 
Results show that, while controlling for the other predictors and the covariates, the 
grit subscale consistency of interests was a positive predictor of exam attempt, Wald 
χ2 = 36.51, p < .001. Academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and perseverance of effort 
did not uniquely contribute to the model, with Wald χ 2 ranging from 0.07 to 2.54, 
ps > .05 (see Table 4).

shows to be a significantly better fit for the data than Model 2 (i.e., the model with 
predictors as fixed variables) and Model 1 (i.e., covariates-only model), none of the 
predictors significantly predicted academic performance, with F(1, 1058.35) = 0.31,

was investigated. Moreover, the unique predictive value of each of the predictors on 
the three aspects of academic success was inquired. In addition, it was explored to 
what extent the predictors overlapped in predicting the academic success outcomes. 
Analyses revealed that consistency of interests, one of the subscales of grit, was the 
most important predictor, as it was found to be positively related to exam attempt 
and study progress after controlling for academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and the 
grit subscale perseverance of effort. However, consistency of interests was not a sig-
nificant predictor of academic performance. Furthermore, academic self-efficacy, 
self-esteem, and perseverance of effort did not uniquely predict any of the academic 
success variables. Moreover, academic self-efficacy, as well as self-esteem, did not 
mediate the relationship between consistency of interests and exam attempt and 
study progress respectively.
Overall, grit showed to be a positive predictor of academic success within tra-
ditional education (e.g., Credé et al., 2017; Datu et al., 2016; Duckworth & Quinn, 
2009). These studies found that only the subscale perseverance of effort was a sig-
nificant contributor in predicting academic success. Credé et  al. (2017) stated in 
their meta-analytic study that perseverance of effort is a stronger predictor of exam 
attempt and performance than consistency of interests and overall grit (i.e., grit 
measured as a higher-order construct). In the present study, in contrast, consist-
ency of interests was a significant predictor of two aspects of academic success (i.e., 
exam attempt and study progress), and perseverance of effort was not. There could 
be several reasons for this contradicting result. For one, most of the previous studies 
had GPA or similar outcome variables, which is different from the outcome vari-
ables exam attempt and study progress. Similar to the present study, Palczyńska and 
Świst (2018) found in their study that consistency of interests and not perseverance 
of effort was related to educational attainment (i.e., highest completed level of edu-
cation). As they explained, not being able to maintain your interests for a long time 
(i.e., consistency of interests) might not make that much of a difference for one’s 
grades (as was also shown in the present study), but it might make it more difficult 
to reach a higher educational level. In this reasoning, it is also possible that students 
with low consistency of interests switch more easily to another course or even drop 
out, which could result in not taking an exam or having low study progress. This 
can also explain why consistency of interests was not related to exam grades (i.e., 
academic performance). It does not however explain why perseverance of effort was 
not found to be a predictor of any of the academic success measurements in higher 
online education.
It could be speculated that the relationship was not found because grit was meas-
ured as a general rather than a domain-specific construct. Recently, researchers 
showed that grit measured in a specific academic domain was more strongly related 
to academic success than generally measured grit (Cormier et  al., 2019; Schmidt 
et al., 2017). Furthermore, Neroni et al. (2019) showed that management of study 
time and effort was an important predictor of academic performance in higher online 
education. Items measuring management of effort (e.g., Even when course materials 
are dull and uninteresting, I manage to keep working until I finish) in their study are 
comparable to perseverance of effort (e.g., I finish whatever I begin) in the present 
study, with the difference of being study-specific instead of general. This indicates","was investigated. Moreover, the unique predictive value of each of the predictors on

to academic success than generally measured grit (Cormier et  al., 2019; Schmidt 
et al., 2017). Furthermore, Neroni et al. (2019) showed that management of study 
time and effort was an important predictor of academic performance in higher online 
education. Items measuring management of effort (e.g., Even when course materials 
are dull and uninteresting, I manage to keep working until I finish) in their study are 
comparable to perseverance of effort (e.g., I finish whatever I begin) in the present 
study, with the difference of being study-specific instead of general. This indicates"

even more that academic grit might be more strongly related to academic success 
than general grit. Future research on academic grit and academic success should 
establish whether this is the case in higher online education.
An additional explanation is that students in higher online education have a spe-
cific profile that is different from students in traditional education. Students in higher 
online education are on average older and often have family- and work obligations 
which is different from traditional higher education students (U.S. Department of 
Education, National Center for Education Statistics  2002). Furthermore, many stu-
dents already have a higher education level degree, and very possibly enrolled in 
higher online education for self-improvement or career advancement. This could 
explain why being consistent in interests might be especially essential to increase 
academic success for students in higher online education.
Although many researchers see the merits of grit, this concept has received con-
siderable criticism. For instance, the question has been raised whether grit and the 
personality trait conscientiousness are two different concepts or whether they are the 
same concept with different names. Credé et al. (2017) showed in their meta-anal-
ysis, conducted in traditional education, that many facets of grit and conscientious-
ness are strongly correlated, albeit stronger for conscientiousness and perseverance 
of effort than for conscientiousness and consistency of interests. Nevertheless, they 
showed that the perseverance of effort facet accounts for unique variance in aca-
demic performance after controlling for conscientiousness and consistency of inter -
ests, which indicates that perseverance of effort should be treated separately from 
conscientiousness. Furthermore, Credé et  al. (2017) pointed out that grit is a sig-
nificant positive predictor of retention, and that grit might be important in education 
where retention rates are problematic, as in higher online education. This indicates 
that grit might be more important in predicting exam attempt and study progress, 
and less important in predicting the level of the grade (i.e., academic performance).
Next, academic self-efficacy was not a significant unique predictor of any aca-
demic success variable. This is not in line with most of the previous studies, as aca-
demic self-efficacy was found to be positively related to academic success for col-
lege students (e.g., Diseth, 2011; Fenning & May, 2013; Stajkovic et al., 2018) as 
well as for higher online students (de Fátima Goulão, 2014; Ergul, 2004; Joo et al., 
2013; Radovan, 2011). Some researchers found that academic self-efficacy acted as 
a mediator between other variables (e.g., grit) and academic success (Usher et al., 
2019; Wolters & Hussain, 2015). However, for a mediation effect to occur, a direct 
main effect of academic self-efficacy on academic success is a prerequisite (Baron 
& Kenny, 1986), which was not present in the current study. One of the reasons 
for not finding a relationship between academic self-efficacy and academic suc-
cess might be that students were asked to report their self-efficacy on one of the 
courses they were following at that moment. However, some students followed more 
than one course at the same time or followed multiple courses sequentially within 
the 14-month period. As academic self-efficacy is often seen as a state and course-
dependent, future research should look at whether the results would be different 
if academic self-efficacy was measured separately for every course followed. Fur -
thermore, it should be acknowledged that the instrument to measure academic self-
efficacy, the MSLQ (Pintrich et al., 1993), was originally developed for traditional","even more that academic grit might be more strongly related to academic success 
than general grit. Future research on academic grit and academic success should 
establish whether this is the case in higher online education.

college students. A previous study showed that the factor structure of the MSLQ-B 
(i.e., learning strategy use) for higher online students differed from the factor struc-
ture of the MSLQ-B for traditional college students (Meijs et al., 2019). It is pos-
sible that the factor structure of the academic self-efficacy subscale of the MSLQ is 
not suitable for higher online students.
Moreover, self-esteem did not predict any of the academic success variables 
when controlled for academic self-efficacy and grit. This is in line with findings in 
traditional education, where researchers mostly failed to find a significant relation-
ship between self-esteem and academic success (Fakari & Tafazzoli, 2015; Gębka, 
2014; Phan, 2010; Trautwein et al., 2006) or found positive relationships with small 
effect sizes (for a review, see Baumeister et al., 2003). Baumeister et al. (2003) sug-
gested that the effect sizes of self-esteem predicting academic success are small or 
non-significant because it is reasonable to believe that self-esteem is not predicting 
academic success but the other way around: high academic success leads to a boost 
for our self-esteem. However, based on data in the present study, it is not possible 
to investigate this, as self-esteem is measured at baseline and academic success is 
measured after 14 months. Also, the non-significant zero-order correlations between 
self-esteem and the three outcome variables already indicate that this is not a plau-
sible explanation. Stupnisky et al. (2007) suggest in their study that self-esteem was 
not directly predicting college students’ academic performance, but indirectly via 
perceived control. Future research should indicate whether this is also true in higher 
online education.
Not finding a unique predictive value of academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and 
perseverance of effort on any of the academic success aspects could hypothetically 
be explained by an existing overlap between predictors. However, the results showed 
that the correlations mutually between the predictors are small to moderate. Further -
more, results showed that the zero-order correlations between these predictors and 
each of the academic success aspects were not significant or significant with insub-
stantially small effect size.
4.1  Strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths. First, it is the first study to our knowledge that 
examined academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and grit in relation to academic suc-
cess in relation to each other. Second, research into the factors underlying academic 
success in higher online education is limited, and the present study contributes to 
the literature on academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and grit in higher online edu-
cation. Third, because of the large sample size, statistical power was high (i.e., the 
chance of a type II error is small). Fourth, for the outcome variable, three operation-
alisations were used, for which three different, appropriate statistical analyses were 
performed: a hierarchical logistic regression analysis for the dichotomous outcome 
variable, a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution to prop-
erly model the count data variable, and a mixed model regression analysis for the","college students. A previous study showed that the factor structure of the MSLQ-B 
(i.e., learning strategy use) for higher online students differed from the factor struc-
ture of the MSLQ-B for traditional college students (Meijs et al., 2019). It is pos-
sible that the factor structure of the academic self-efficacy subscale of the MSLQ is

multilevel outcome variable. This contributed significantly to the robustness of the 
results.
Besides these strengths, some limitations should be noted. Because this study has 
an observational design, strong causal conclusions cannot be drawn. Furthermore, stu-
dents were able to follow as many courses as they wanted within the 14 months period 
and followed all different kinds of courses, thus this may lead to inconsistency in how 
participants interpret some of the variables measured, and result in reduced strengths 
in associations with outcome variables. As mentioned earlier, students were asked 
to answer the questions on academic self-efficacy with keeping in mind one of the 
courses they were following but for what course they filled out the questionnaire was 
not inquired. Future research should reveal whether a relationship between academic 
self-efficacy and academic success exists when academic self-efficacy is measured for 
every taken course separately. In addition, the questionnaire that was used to measure 
academic self-efficacy was originally developed for traditional college students, and no 
normative data was found for using this questionnaire in an online student population in 
the age range of 18–80 years. It is possible that the factor structure of this questionnaire 
is different for higher online education students than for traditional college students. 
Further, academic success was restricted to the first 14 months of their studies in the 
present study. Although this is a reasonable duration because this is the typical duration 
for completing a course, it would be valuable to know whether these results remain the 
same when students are further in their academic careers. Lastly, nowadays, education 
for the population described in this study shifted from individualised to cohort-based 
education. Future research should focus on investigating whether these results still hold 
for the higher online education students in a cohort-based educational system.
4.2  General conclusion and implications
Academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and perseverance of effort did not uniquely predict 
exam attempt, study progress, and academic performance in higher online education, 
which is not in line with previous studies in traditional education. Furthermore, aca-
demic self-efficacy and self-esteem did not mediate the relationship between grit and 
any of the academic success variables. Consistency of interests, however, was found 
to be an important and direct predictor of exam attempt and study progress in higher 
online education, even when academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and perseverance of 
effort were controlled for. This is a unique finding, as most studies in traditional educa-
tion did not find any relationship between consistency of interests and academic suc-
cess. The higher online students at this institution have 14 months to finish a course, 
which is a long time compared to traditional education, so in a way, it is plausible that 
being able to maintain a focus of interest is an important aspect of studying success-
fully. For teachers and instructors, it is important to stimulate students as much as pos-
sible to keep them focussed on finishing their courses and eventually finishing the edu-
cational program.
