Abstract—For the students, poor time-use habits can easily 
lead to academic failure. The online learning environment is full 
of learning resources, and students are not able to get monitor  
and guide of the teachers face-to-face. Therefore, students are  
expected to have  better time management skills. In this  study, 
67 middle school students were taken as examples to study their 
online assignments in LMS in three semesters, and four 
indicators of time-use habit were constructed: submission, 
procrastination, speed and regularity. These indicators were 
used to analyze their prediction effect to students’ learning 
performance. The results show that there is a significant 
negative correlation between procrastination and learning 
performance, and the predictive power of procrastination is the 
best; there is a significant positive correlation between 
assignments submission times and learning performance and 
speed is also. While regularity does not show significant 
correlation with learning performance.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, the time and human cognitive resources that 
people can use are limited. Therefore, how to manage limited 
time reasonably to help us accomplish tasks in work and study

Students are no exception. Students often face a heavy burden 
of academic work. If they cannot effectively manage their 
time, they will be prone to academic failure. However, 
academic procrastination seems to become a common 
problem for students. If they cannot realize and correct their 
bad time-use habits, it will not be conducive to students’ 
academic improvement. 
Time-use habit is an important part of self-regulation 
ability, and has been analyzed by a large number of 
researchers on its relationship with learning performance. 
However, current measurement of time-use habits still relies 
on student self-reports, such as questionnaires. Due to the 
social approval, students often do not respond objectively to 
expressions such as “I am not in a hurry to perform my duties.” 
At present, most of the research on time-use habits focus 
on traditional classroom context, but the time-use habits in 
online learning are more critical. There are two reasons. First, 
online learning is an asynchronous context and the time and 
space are more flexible. Students can arrange the time and 
progress of learning more freely, so there are more 
requirements for students’ time management ability. Second, 
online learning lacks face-to-face interaction between teachers 
and students, and students cannot fully receive the attention 
and encouragement from teachers. In the online learning 
environment, students generate a large amount of learning 
behavior data in the learning management system (LMS). 
With learning analytics, the student behavior data is processed 
and analyzed, and the analysis results are more objective and 
scientific than self-report. Therefore, time-use habits in online 
learning should be an important topic of research. 
Based on the above expressions, this study focuses on 
students’ online assignments from the perspective of learning

II. RELATED WORK 
The research on time-use habits is mainly divided into two 
types of learning context: traditional learning context and 
online learning context. In the traditional learning context, 
Kelly used Time-use Efficiency Scale to investigate the time-
use habits of 141 graduate students. The questionnaire consists 
of three dimensions: awareness of time, awareness of that 
which Fills time and positive in-task work habits. The results 
have shown that the higher the score of the students’ 
questionnaire, the higher the students’ GPA [1]. Macan and 
Shahani used the Time Management Behavior Scale. The 
questionnaire consists of four dimensions: Setting goals and 
priorities, Planning and Scheduling, Perceived Control of 
Time, Preference for Disorganization. By testing 165 students, 
the study found that the higher the student’s questionnaire 
score, the higher the academic score, and the less academic 
pressure. And the Perceived Control of Time has the strongest 
influence on academic performance [2]. Adebayo developed 
the Time Management and Students Academic Performance 
(TMSAP) questionnaire. The questionnaire focused on the 
procrastination, planning and prioritization of 200 college 
students. The results showed that three dimensions had 
significant impacts on academic performance. In addition to 
the relationship between time-use habits and academic 
achievement, some researchers have studied the mediation of 
other factors [3]. For example, Osman et al. used self-efficacy 
as a moderator variable of time-use habits and academic 
achievement. Using a structural equation model to conduct a 
questionnaire survey of 226 college students, the results 
showed that self-efficacy can be used as an effective 
moderator variable, and there is a significant positive 
correlation between time-use habits and academic 
achievement [4]. Won and Yu selected 194 high school 
students who participated in the STEM course, to understand 
the impact of their parents’ support on their time-use habits.

the relationship between time-use habits and academic

correlation between time-use habits and academic 
achievement. Won and Yu selected 194 high school 
students who participated in the STEM course, to understand 
the impact of their parents’ support on their time-use habits. 
The study defined the time-use habits as three dimensions:"
2019 - Does Time Play a Role Prediction of Learning Performance with Time-use Habits in Online Assignments.pdf,"planning time, monitoring time and procrastination. The 
results showed that the greater the parents support the students, 
the stronger the students’ ability to plan and monitor the time, 
and the weaker the procrastination [5]. In addition, a study by 
Balkis and Duru has shown that girls are less likely to show 
academic procrastination than boys [6]. This finding is 
consistent with Pehlivan’s research [7]. 
In online learning context, researchers focus more on how 
to improve students’ time-use habits and verify the 
effectiveness of interventions. For example, Tabuneca used an 
Android app to help students monitor their online learning 
time and use the Validity and Reliability of Time Management 
Questionnaire (VRTMQ) to investigate students’ time 
planning, time attitudes and time wasters. The study found that 
monitoring learning time can help students improve their time 
management skills, and push reminders to students through 
the app at regular intervals can effectively correct their bad 
time habits [8]. Kim et al. used the Learning Analytics 
Dashboard (LAD) to help students manage their time. A 
survey of 151 college students found that students using the 
LAD had significantly higher scores than those who did not 
use the LAD [9]. 
It can be found that even in the online learning context, 
most of the relevant research still use the traditional 
questionnaire survey method t o measure the students’ time-
use habits, and the use of online behavioral data indicators to 
quantify the time-use habits is still a minority. However, some 
results have a good inspiration for this study. For example, Jo 
et al. constructed three variables related to time management, 
namely Total login time, Login frequency, Regularity of login 
interval. The first two variables can be directly summed from 
the original data, and the third variable is the result of 
calculating standard deviation. The results showed that the 
three variables can reflect the students’ time management 
ability. The longer the login time, the higher the frequency, 
and the more regular login, the better the time management 
ability of the students [10]. 
Through the above analysis, it can be found that the factors 
that can represent the time-use habits can be summarized as 
procrastination, time planning and monitoring, which can be 
defined as four factors of submission, procrastination, speed 
and regularity in online learning environment. Therefore, the 
research questions of this study are as follows: 
(1) How to use online learning behavior data to 
characterize the submission, procrastination, speed and 
regularity in online assignments? 
(2) Are there differences among different types of students 
in regard to submission, procrastination, speed, and regularity 
in online assignments? 
(3) Can the submission, procrastination, speed and 
regularity in online assignments predict students’ learning 
performance effectively?

ETHODOLOGY 
A. Participants and Context 
The learning management system (LMS) used in this 
study is the Cloudbag platform, developed by the Intelligent 
Learning System Lab of Beijing Normal University. The 
platform can support students to view videos, take online 
assignments, interact in the forum and other learning activities. 
This study selected the online assignments to analyze the 
students’ time-use habits. 
A total of 67 students from a middle school in Guizhou 
Province of China participated in the study, and the 
participants enrolled in nine courses in LMS. The study lasted 
for three semesters. The first semester was from March 2016 
to June 2016, during which all students generated a total of 
1,743 assignments; the second semester was from September 
2016 to December 2016, during which all students generated 
a total of 591 assignments; the third semester was from March 
2017 to June 2017, during which time all students generated a 
total of 728 assignments. 
B. Measures 
1) Classfication of Learning Outcome 
Krumm et al. believed that the level of online learning 
outcomes can be analyzed by a combination of exam scores 
and the number of LMS visits [11]. All students in this study 
were divided into three categories, A to C. From Class A to 
Class C, students’ learning outcomes are high to low. This 
study calculated the average score of each student in the final 
exam of the three semester, and counted the ranking of the 
total number of LMS visits of each student, and 
comprehensively obtained the classification of the learning 
outcome. There are 16 students in Class A, 39 students in 
Class B, and 12 students in Class C. TABLE I shows the 
learning outcome classification scheme.

descriptive statistics of the four indicators of student time-use 
habits. Then, using one-way analysis of variance, we 
investigated whether there was a significant difference in the 
time-use habits among the three types of students. Finally, 
multiple linear regression methods were used to test the 
predictive effect of online assignments time-use habits on 
learning performance.

ESULTS 
A. Descriptive Statistics of Time-use Habits in Online 
Assignments 
TABLE II shows the overall performance of students in 
terms of time-use habits. The average number of assignments  
submission per student is 53.15, but the number varies from 
student to student. The number of the most assignments 
submission by one person is 110, while the least is only 23. In 
terms of procrastination, the average is 0.4 (<0.5), reflecting  
that students generally can complete homework in the first 
half of the specified period, and the overall procrastination is 
mild. In terms of speed, the average is 170.89, and the standard 
deviation is 2.24, indicating that the difference in speed 
between different students is not large. In terms of regularity, 
the class average is 4.27, which indicates that the moment for 
students to complete the assignment is not very fixed.

B. Differences among Different Classifications of Students 
in Regard to Their Online Assignments Time-use Habits 
This study separately analyzed the differences among 
students of different categories, in regard to their time-use 
habits of each semester. TABLE III shows that, in terms of the 
number of assignments submission, Class B students was the 
highest (56.333) while Class C students was the least (41.667), 
but the three types of students did not show significant 
differences. In terms of procrastination, there is a significan t 
difference between the three categories of students (F=12.679, 
Sig.=.000<.001). Class A students have the lowest value 
(.329), indicating the least degree of procrastination; while 
Class C students have the biggest number (.536), indicating 
the most procrastination. By different semester, the three types 
of students showed significant differences (F = 5.053, Sig. 
= .006 <.01) only in the first semester. In addition, from the 
first semester to the third semester, the three types of students 
g r a d u a l l y  i n c r e a s e d  t h e i r  s c o r e s ,  i n d i c a t i n g  t h a t  t h e  
procrastination of students has become more and more serious 
with the passage of time. In terms of speed, in general, Class 
C students have the lowest value (168.979), indicating that 
they have the fastest speed; while Class A students have the 
highest value (171.900), indicating that it is the slowest. By 
different semester, the three types of students showed 
significant differences (F = 6.418, Sig. = .003 <.01) only in 
the second semester. At the same time, as the study progresses, 
the three classes of students complete the practice faster and 
faster. In terms of regularity, the overall three categories of  
students did not show significant differences. However, in the 
third semester, the three types of students showed significant 
differences (F=4.081, Sig.=.035<.05). Class A students have 
the lowest number (2.188), indicating that students are more 
likely to complete assignments at regular intervals per day; 
while Class C students have the highest number (3.030), 
indicating that there is no obvious tendency for such students 
to practice during the time period.

completes the assignment.

Regularity: the tendency of students to start working at a 
specific time. ௦௧௔௥௧  is the time each student starts 
answering assignments (only extract the hour part). Regularity 
equals to the standard deviation of the starting time of each 
assignment. The smaller the value, the more students tend to 
c o m p l e t e  h o m e w o r k  a t  a  f i x e d  m o m e n t .

C. Process 
After quantifying the time-use habits in the online 
assignment, this study used SPSS 20.0 to conduct a 
descriptive statistics of the four indicators of student time-use 
habits. Then, using one-way analysis of variance, we 
investigated whether there was a significant difference in the 
time-use habits among the three types of students. Finally, 
multiple linear regression methods were used to test the 
predictive effect of online assignments time-use habits on 
learning performance. 
IV. RESULTS 
A. Descriptive Statistics of Time-use Habits in Online 
Assignments 
TABLE II shows the overall performance of students in 
terms of time-use habits. The average number of assignments  
submission per student is 53.15, but the number varies from 
student to student. The number of the most assignments 
submission by one person is 110, while the least is only 23. In 
terms of procrastination, the average is 0.4 (<0.5), reflecting  
that students generally can complete homework in the first 
half of the specified period, and the overall procrastination is 
mild. In terms of speed, the average is 170.89, and the standard 
deviation is 2.24, indicating that the difference in speed 
between different students is not large. In terms of regularity, 
the class average is 4.27, which indicates that the moment for 
students to complete the assignment is not very fixed. 
B. Differences among Different Classifications of Students 
in Regard to Their Online Assignments Time-use Habits 
This study separately analyzed the differences among 
students of different categories, in regard to their time-use 
habits of each semester. TABLE III shows that, in terms of the 
number of assignments submission, Class B students was the 
highest (56.333) while Class C students was the least (41.667), 
but the three types of students did not show significant 
differences. In terms of procrastination, there is a significan t 
difference between the three categories of students (F=12.679, 
Sig.=.000<.001). Class A students have the lowest value 
(.329), indicating the least degree of procrastination; while 
Class C students have the biggest number (.536), indicating 
the most procrastination. By different semester, the three types 
of students showed significant differences (F = 5.053, Sig. 
= .006 <.01) only in the first semester. In addition, from the 
first semester to the third semester, the three types of students 
g r a d u a l l y  i n c r e a s e d  t h e i r  s c o r e s ,  i n d i c a t i n g  t h a t  t h e  
procrastination of students has become more and more serious 
with the passage of time. In terms of speed, in general, Class 
C students have the lowest value (168.979), indicating that 
they have the fastest speed; while Class A students have the 
highest value (171.900), indicating that it is the slowest. By 
different semester, the three types of students showed 
significant differences (F = 6.418, Sig. = .003 <.01) only in 
the second semester. At the same time, as the study progresses, 
the three classes of students complete the practice faster and 
faster. In terms of regularity, the overall three categories of  
students did not show significant differences. However, in the 
third semester, the three types of students showed significant 
differences (F=4.081, Sig.=.035<.05). Class A students have 
the lowest number (2.188), indicating that students are more 
likely to complete assignments at regular intervals per day; 
while Class C students have the highest number (3.030), 
indicating that there is no obvious tendency for such students 
to practice during the time period."
2019 - Does Time Play a Role Prediction of Learning Performance with Time-use Habits in Online Assignments.pdf,"C. Predicting Learning Performance Based on Students’ 
Online Assignments Time-use Habits 
Calculate the average score of students’ final exam in the 
three semester, and analyze the relationship between students’ 
time-use habits and exam scores. Through correlation analysis 
(see TABLE IV), it is found that there is a significant negative 
correlation between procrastination and exam scores, that is, 
the more serious the student procrastinate, the worse the 
learning performance; the speed and learning performance 
have a significant positive correlation, that is, the longer th e 
student completes the assignment, the better the learning 
performance. The number of assignments submission and 
regularity do not show a significant correlation with learning 
performance.

GRA .209 -.488*** .466*** .035 1 
Note: SUB means submission, PRO means procrastination, 
SPE means speed, REG means regularity and GRA means 
grade. The same as below. 
In order to understand the predictive effect of time-use 
habits on learning performance further, this study used the 
number of submissions, procrastination, speed and regularity 
as predictors, and used students’ exam scores as the outcome 
variable. Stepwise method for multiple regression analysis 
was used to investigate learning performance can be explained 
by time-use habits to what extent. Four variables were entered 
in sequence to form four regression equations (see TABLE V). 
It was found that the four predictors have a high degree of 
explanatory power for learning performance, with R
2 as high 
as 0.527, indicating that the predictor can explain the 52.7% 
change in learning performance. Since the number of samples 
is small, the adjusted R
2 should be used, and the interpretation 
ratio of 49.6% is also satisfactory. Among them, the negative 
prediction effect of procrastination is significant, while the 
speed and the number of assignments submission show a 
significant positive prediction effect. Specific to the predictive 
contribution of each predictor to learning performance, it can 
be seen that the contribution of procrastination is the highest, 
which can explain 22.6% of the exam scores; the second is the 
number of assignments submission, which can explain 21.9% 
(49.6% minus 27.7%) of the exam scores. The last is speed, 
which can explain 6.1% of the scores (29.9% minus 23.8%). 
The regularity does not produce a predictive contribution to 
the score because it does not reach a significant level.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
From the above analysis, procrastination has the most 
obvious impact on learning performance. The more serious 
the academic procrastination, the more likely students are fail 
academically. Therefore, in online learning environment, 
teachers should focus on students who often start assignments 
only when they are close to the deadline. At the same time, as 
time progresses, students’ procrastination is generally more 
and more serious, reflecting the phenomenon that students are 
prone to fatigue and slackness during the learning process. 
Therefore, teachers should take measures to help students 
maintain their motivation to learn, such as adjusting the 
difficulty of assignments, or setting the reward system. 
The number of submissions has a good predictive effect 
on learning performance. Through assignments, students can 
check and reflect on their own learning. The more the number 
of assignments, the more familiar the students are to their 
overall level of knowledge. Teachers can also intervene and 
guide students more specifically through the results of the 
assignments. 
In terms of the speed of completing the assignment, due to 
the lack of face-to-face pressure on the teacher in the online 
learning environment, students tend to lack in-depth thinking 
when they practice, and rush to submit assignments. Therefore, 
the more time invested in the assignment, the more attentive 
the student answers. Teachers can emphasize the importance 
of online assignment during the course assessment and attract 
students’ attention. 
Regularity does not show a predictive effect on learning 
performance. The reason is that the time at which students 
start their homework is largely influenced by the time the 
teacher releases it, and is less affected by the student’s own 
plan for time. However, with the passage of time, Class A 
students formed a more fixed assignment time in the third 
semester. So, when teachers arrange the assignment, it can be 
fixed at certain time periods to help students develop stable 
time-use habits.
