Abstract—
Advances in Information and Communications 
Technology (ICT) have increased the growth of Massive open 
online courses (MOOCs) applied in distance learning environ-
ments. Various tools have been utilized to deliver interactive con-
tent including pictures, figures, and videos that can motivate the 
learners to build new cognitive skills. High ranking universities 
have adopted MOOCs as an efficient dashboard platform where 
learners from around the world can participate in such courses. 
The students learning progress is evaluated by using set computer-
marked assessments. In particular, the computer gives immediate 
feedback to the student once he or she completes the online assess-
ments.  
The researchers claim that student success rate in an online 
course can be related to their performance at the previous session 
in addition to the level of engagement. Insufficient attention has 
been paid by literature to evaluate whether student performance 
and engagement in the prior assessments could affect student 
achievement in the next assessments. 
In this paper, two predictive models have been designed namely 
students’ assessments grades and final students’ performance. The 
models can be used to detect the factors that influence students’ 
learning achievement in MOOCs. The result shows that both mod-
els gain feasible and accurate results. The lowest RSME gain by  
RF  acquire a value of 8.131  for students assessments grades 
model while GBM yields the highest accuracy in final students’ 
performance, an average value of 0.086 was achieved.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is one of the most 
widespread e-learning platforms. The MOOCs present the 
course using digital tool materials in various forms such as 
visual, audio, video and plain text. Most students prefer using 
video lectures to understand the contents of lessons over 
thoroughly reading plain text documents. The interactive video 
in the MOOCs could reduce students’ stress, help them to feel 
relaxed and learn quickly [1] [2]. 
  MOOCs can be classified into two distinct types mainly, 
connectivist Massive Open Online Courses (cMOOCs) and 
eXtended Massive Open Online Courses (xMOOCs).The 
xMOOCs are learning paradigm based on the principles of 
cognitivist behaviorist theory[4]. The structure of the courses is 
similar to the traditional course where the syllabus consists of a 
set of video lectures and a set of multiple choice quizzes in 
addition to the final exam. The video lectures featuring the 
course instructor reviewing the content of the previous online 
lesson are released weekly. The participants can watch and 
pause the video at their own pace.  Moreover, the students can 
socially interact with other pa rticipants and the instructor 
through posting in discussion forums. The instructors usually 
post questions, provide task solutions and reply to student 
questions via these discussion forums; as a consequence the 
discussion forums play a vital role in enhancing the course 
quality and make online sessions collaborative and engaging [3] 
[5]. 
 The cMOOCs are a new learning model based on 
connectivist learning theory [3][4]. With the connectivism 
approach, the instructor would not provide the actual learning 
material; the students get the course syllabus by asking the 
questions and sharing this information with other participants. 
References [3][4][5] posit the learning strategy of cMOOCs

other students.  
With cMOOCs, it is impossible to involve expertise to assess 
the students' knowledge whereas in xMOOCs, university 
lecturers can evaluate the students’ knowledge through the use 
of computer-marked assessment feedback. In particular, the

II. LITERATURE REVIEW  
Student performance is a key indicator of measuring learning 
progress in a virtual learning environment. Researchers have 
adopted various methods to monitor performance [1]. In this  
section, the literature  review in the relevant area is presented.  
The Factor Analysis Model (FAM) was proposed to predict 
the student's performance in Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) 
taking into consideration the difficulty level of assessments 
based on Item Response Theory concept [9] [10]. The difficulty 
level of tasks can infer measurement of the correlation between 
the student’s performances and assessment questions. To 
compute the probability of a student solving a task correctly, a 
set of predictor variables are defined in the FAM including the 
number of opportunities presented to the student at each task, 
the duration spent on each step and the difficulty level of each 
question or latent variable. The results reveal that incorporating 
the latent variables into the estimates of student performance 
can significantly enhance the model [10]. 
To measure how the activities of learners could impact their 
learning achievement in MOOCs, the researchers found that 
Learning Analytics (LAs) in conjunction with machine 
learning, are effective tools that offer the potential to trace 
student knowledge. The researchers demonstrated that machine 
learning could help the educator in providing cohort 
information about the learning process, furnishing researchers 
with the ability to both visualis e and analyse the information 
obtained from each tier of the learner. Thus, an accurate 
predictive model can be acquired in such courses[11] [12][13].  
Students’ marks in the first assessment and quiz scores in 
conjunction with social factors are used to predict students’ 
final performance in online course [14]. Two predictive models 
were introduced. In the first model, logistic regression was used 
to predict whether students gained a normal or distinction 
certificate. In the second predictive model, logistic regression 
was also used to predict if students achieved certification or not. 
The results indicated that the number of peer assessment is the 
most effective feature for acquiring a distinction. The average 
quiz scores were considered the most reliable predictor for 
earning a certificate. The accuracy of distinction and normal 
models were reported with the percentage of  92.6% for the first 
model and 79.6 % for the second model, respectively[14]. 
The association between the Virtual Learning Environment 
(VLE) data and student performance has been investigated at 
the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) [12]. 
LA used through the implementation of the Check My Activity 
(CMA) tool. CMA can be defined as an LA tool, which com-
pares students VLE activities with other activities and provides 
lecturers frequent feedback of students’ emotional states. The 
results showed the students who engage with the course 
frequently are more likely to earn mark C or higher than those 
who did not regularly engage [12].

and the assessment mark[15]. 
The “Student Registration” table contains information about 
the date the students registered and unregistered in a particular 
module. The overall date is measured by counting numbers of 
unique days that students interact with courses until the course 
ends. In Open University online courses, students are able to 
access a module even before being a student of the course; 
however, it is not possible to access the course post-course 
closure date. The students' information related to their 
interaction with digital is store in learners Virtual Learning 
Environment dataset. 
B) Feature Extraction 
The features extraction was undertaken in our previous 
work[16]. The VLE activities were used to generate 
behavioural features. For each student at a specific time t, two 
features are extracted: the number of sessions ݋
௧) and the 
number of clicks ((௧). The behavioral features can be divided 
as either static or dynamic. 
• Static Behavioral features: These are a set of behavioral 
features that correspond to student activities since the first time 
they engaged in the course till last day they quit the course. Let 
us consider the set ∈ℝ ்	×	௡	×	௠, in which ௧,௜,௝ represents 
the jth activity of the ith student at time t. S is a set of students 
denoted as an n-dimensional vector [ S1 ….,  Sn], where n is the 
number of students. Furthermore, M is defined as an m-dimen-
sional vector that represents VLE learning activity types, M = 
[M1 …., Mm], where m is the number of learning activities 
that the ith student is assigned.  
• Dynamic Behavioral Features: These are a set of behav-
ioral features that vary over time. Let t be a sequence of dis-
jointed time intervals, where t ∈ [1,6]. To represent all student 
activities at time t, we define the type of student’s activity rec-
ords as the vector ௧,௜,௠,]. Here jth de-
notes learning activity that is undertaken at time t by student 
Si, such that j = 1, the, m; where m is given as the number of 
learning activities. 
 
C) Students’ performance Model 
Two sets of experiments are conducted in this case study. In 
the first experiment, the dynamic behavioral features are 
considered to predict student performance, while the static 
behavioral attributes are employed in the second experiment. 
The problems are formulated as classification and regression. 
The regression setting is considered when we aim to predict 
students’ assessments grades, whereas classification setting is 
utilised when we seek to predict final student performance in 
the entire course. It is considered a multi-class problem where 
the target class is whether students pass, fail or withdraw from 
courses.   
Early grade prediction could he lp educators deliver timely 
intervention support and additional learning materials to help 
students who have low scores[17]. As discussed previously, the 
student should participate in five CMA assessments and six 
TMA assessments, in addition to the final exam. The 
assessments should be handed in within a specific period. Due 
to the TMA assessment weighing 45% of the final result, while 
the CMA assessment weighs only 5%, our temporal analysis is 
based on the submission date of the TMA. 
In first set experiments, student performance is predicated in 
a timely manner, as can be seen, in Figure 1 the course is 
subsequently the into six-time intervals, corresponding with 
assessment submission dates. The student behavioral records 
are distributed according to the assessment date. The student 
performance in prior assessments with their interaction 
behavior is considered in this analysis. 
In the second set of experiments, we evaluated the 
trajectories student performance by  aggregate the student’s 
behavioral activities across the six-time slices into a single time 
slice. The behavioral features, demographic features and 
temporal features are used as input variables. We did not 
account for past assessments grade, and final exam mark as 
target class is computed based on these features. The dataset 
contains 4004 records where the proportion of “fail”, 
“withdrawn” and “pass” classes are 28%t,40% and 32% 
respectively.  
In order to evaluate the student performance predictive 
model across two experiments, several metrics have been 
considered. In terms of the regression analysis, the Root Mean 
Square Error (RMSE) and   R-squaredܴ
ଶ) are used to predict 
students’ assessment grades. With regards, to the classification 
analysis accuracy, specificity and sensitivity, F-Measure, 
Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC), and Area Under 
Curve (AUC) are employed to predict final student 
performance. Furthermore, tenfold cross-validation is used for 
both a regression and classification analysis; 50% of the dataset 
is selected to train the algorithms. A further 50% of the data is 
disjointed from the original dataset, and was used to evaluate 
the generalization errors for unseen data. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 D) Features selection  
 As our aim is to investigate the impact of student performance 
in the previous assessment in to the following assessment, 
features selection is only consider for the first set of experiment. 
Recursive Feature Elimination (R FE) is utilized in this case 
study. 
Rrecursive feature elimination is one of the most popular 
wrapper feature selection approaches. RFE can be defined as an 
optimisation algorithm based on backwards selection and 
resampling techniques [18].  It keeps recursively creating the

  Figure 1.Student behavioral features based on TMA intervals"
Rao and Kumar - 2021 - Students Performance Prediction in Online Courses Using Machine Learning Algorithms.pdf,"model until it gets a small number of features. The data set is 
partitioned into train and bootstrap samples with different 
elements. At each iteration, the algorithms are chosen as the 
most important features. To assess the probability of ranking 
features, the new model that includes the most essential 
predictors is retained until all   are exhausted[19][20]. 
The results of the features selection across six intervals are 
listed in Table 1. It is based on RMSE criteria. The results 
reveal that students’ assessments grades during the previous 
slice occupy the position of highest top features across all 
intervals.  
The “session.homepage” and “sum_click.homepage” of the 
previous and current time slice are the most important features 
across all intervals. It also appears that “sum_click.forumng” 
and “session.forumng” have been selected as top features, only 
for intervals 1 and 2. In gene ral, the activities (“homepage”,” 
quiz”,” subpage”) robustly predicted the students’ grades over 
all time intervals.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
E) Simulation results- Students Assessments Grades Model                                                                           
The regression analysis has been applied to predict students’ 
assessment grades over six-time intervals. Table  2 list the result 
of regression analysis .Two sets of features are considered. In 
the first set of features, dynamic behavioural features and 
student performance are used as predictors, while only the top 
five features are employed in the second set of features. 
Various machine learning models  are used in this 
experiment, including Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer 
Perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers,  Neural Networks 
with single hidden layer ( Nnet), Gradient Boosting Machine 
(GBM) and Generalized Linear Model (GLM). 
The empirical results from the first set of features have 
acquired slightly better performance than the selected features. 
However, the Mlp and Rpart in the second set of features offer 
better results. The RMSE metric measures the difference 
between the predicted values and the actual observations. The 
lowest RMSE value demonstrates the better performance of the 
predictive model. In terms of the first set of features, RF obtains 
the best RMSE achieving values of 8.131 over interval 3. For 
the second set of features, the Gbm model gives the best RMSE, 
with a value of 11.230 over interval 1. 
As can be seen, for both set of features the Gbm models over 
interval 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 give the best RMSE, with averages 
values of 11-22. RF occupies the second-best model. The 
RMSE increased by 3% in Glm across all intervals and acquired 
an average value of 11-23. Mlp acquired the worst RMSE, with 
a value of 44.904 and 39.215 at interval 6 for both sets of 
features. In general, Mlp achieves the poorest RMSE across all 
intervals for both sets of features.

partitioned into train and bootstrap samples with different 
elements. At each iteration, the algorithms are chosen as the 
most important features. To assess the probability of ranking 
features, the new model that includes the most essential 
predictors is retained until all are exhausted. 
The results of the features selection across six intervals are 
listed in Table 1. It is based on RMSE criteria. The results 
reveal that students’ assessments grades during the previous 
slice occupy the position of highest top features across all 
intervals.  
The “session.homepage” and “sum_click.homepage” of the

The classification analysis results for the second experiment 
presented as follows. The same set of machine learning 
classifiers in the previous experiment are used in this case 
study. 
As can be seen in a Table 3 all classifiers obtain similar ideal 
results, the highest performance achieved by Gbm with the 
value of 0.868 while RF, Nnet producing the value of 0.854, 
achieved the lowest accuracy. Table 4 shows the class “With-
drawn” acquired the best accuracy of all Classifiers reaching an 
average value of 0.99 whereas the class “Fail” gives the lowest 
performance, with an approximate range of accuracy between 
0.76-0.80. 
The sensitivities are high overall classifiers for class “With-
draw” and “Pass”. The best sensitivity achieved by Rpart re-
ported the values of 0.99 and 0.92. The class “Fail” gained very 
low sensitivities across all classifiers. This is expected since the 
number of records with target class “Fail” are limited hence, the 
algorithm cannot learn well. With regards, to true negative 
instance, the Gbm and Nnet produce the best result, specificity 
=0.998 for class “Withdrawn”. The poorest specificity gained 
by Rpart for class “Pass” obtained the values of   0.81. As can 
be seen, the best F1-Measure gained by Gbm yielded a value of 
0.993, 0.864, 0.772, for the class “Withdrawn”,” Pass” and 
“Fail” respectively. The lowest F1-Measure is shown for Rpart 
with the value of 0.67 over class “Fail”. 
ROC is used in this study to choose a decision threshold value 
for the true and false positive rate across each class. Figure 2 
lists ROC curves. Overall, a range of AUC values between 
0.99-0.82 for all classes was obtained. As previously men-
tioned, the demographic behavioral and temporal features in 
classification analysis were combined. In this model the total 
numbers of variables are 35. As a result, the predictive model 
may suffer from the overfitting issue.  In this case, we compare 
classifiers results in terms of train and test error which could 
give an indication of the overfitting problem.  
Figure 3 displays the result of overfitting evaluation. It can 
be observed that training and test error are low for all classifiers.  
The lowest test and train error was obtained by Gbm. The RF 
,Nnet obtained a similar test error with an approximate 
percentage of 14%. The training errors are slightly higher in 
these classifiers. The largest error was acquired by the Mlp 
model. Although all models fit well for most classifiers, Mlp 
suffers from overfitting.

The regression and classification analysis are considered in 
This case study. The result of predicting students’ assessments 
grades model shows that best RMSE and ଶacquire over 
interval 3 while worst RMSE and ଶ are shown for intervals 5 
and 6.This could be attributed to a number of students record 
over interval 3 than other interval as a result; The algorithm can 
learn more and model will fit well. In contrast to, the lowest 
number of training example shown over interval 6. 
Final student performance predictive model revels ideal 
sensitivities and specificities for all classifiers Although, the 
sensitivities and specificities are balanced for all classifiers over 
class “Withdrawn” and “Pass”, the specificities are higher than 
corresponding sensitivities for class “Fail”. This is due to; the 
database is skewed in favor of chosen the majority classes 
“Withdrawn” and “Pass”. In this case, predict withdrawal 
students are more priority than predict success and fail students 
as it is worthwhile to predict students who withdraw from the 
entire course than students who stay engaged with the course. 
The primary reason the machine learning models obtain 
higher performance in classification than regression is the 
relevant to the type of features sets. As such, in classification 
analysis, the static behavioral features in conjunction with the 
temporal features and demographic features are used as input 
variables in the prediction of final student performance model 
while only dynamic behavioral features employed to estimate 
students’ assessments grades. The temporal features that 
include the date of student registration and un-registration in an 
online course are robust predictors features that adequately 
impact on student achievement. It could be impossible to 
combine the temporal features with behavioral features with 
respect to regression analysis as the database include student 
temporal information for the entire period. 
IV. C
ONCLUSION  
Two sets of exterminates have been carried out in this study 
using regression and classification analysis. The results of 
predicting students’ assessments grades model show that the 
students’ performance in a particular assignment relies on 
students’ mark in the previous assignment within single 
Courses.  The researchers conclude that students’ prior grade 
point average (GPA) with a low mark is considered as a 
significant factor of withdrawal from the next course in the 
traditional classroom setting, 
Both conventional classroom setting and virtual class share 
similar characteristic in term of the effective of pervious 
performance into student learning achievement in the future.  
The final student performance predictive model revealed that 
student engagement with digital material has a significant im-
pact on their success in the entire course. The findings’ results 
also demonstrate that long -term students’ performance 
achieves better accuracy than students’ assessments grades pre-
diction model, due to the exclusion of temporal features in re-
gression analysis. The date of student deregistration from the 
course is a valuable predictor that is significantly correlated 
with student performance. With the regression analysis, the data 
does not provide the last date of students’ activity prior to un-
dertaken assessments. The findings’ results have been recom-
mended to take into account the temporal features on predicting 
of subsequent assessments grades. 
Future research direction involves the use of temporal 
features for predicting students’ assessments grades model. 
With temporal feature time series analysis will be untaken, 
might be more advanced machine leering will be utilized.

entire course than students who stay engaged with the course. 
The primary reason the machine learning models obtain 
higher performance in classification than regression is the 
relevant to the type of features sets. As such, in classification 
analysis, the static behavioral features in conjunction with the 
temporal features and demographic features are used as input 
variables in the prediction of final student performance model 
while only dynamic behavioral features employed to estimate 
students’ assessments grades. The temporal features that 
include the date of student registration and un-registration in an 
online course are robust predictors features that adequately 
impact on student achievement. It could be impossible to 
combine the temporal features with behavioral features with 
respect to regression analysis as the database include student 
temporal information for the entire period.

ONCLUSION  
Two sets of exterminates have been carried out in this study 
using regression and classification analysis. The results of 
predicting students’ assessments grades model show that the 
students’ performance in a particular assignment relies on 
students’ mark in the previous assignment within single 
Courses.  The researchers conclude that students’ prior grade 
point average (GPA) with a low mark is considered as a 
significant factor of withdrawal from the next course in the 
traditional classroom setting, 
Both conventional classroom setting and virtual class share 
similar characteristic in term of the effective of pervious 
performance into student learning achievement in the future.  
The final student performance predictive model revealed that 
student engagement with digital material has a significant im-
pact on their success in the entire course. The findings’ results 
also demonstrate that long -term students’ performance 
achieves better accuracy than students’ assessments grades pre-
diction model, due to the exclusion of temporal features in re-
gression analysis. The date of student deregistration from the 
course is a valuable predictor that is significantly correlated 
with student performance. With the regression analysis, the data 
does not provide the last date of students’ activity prior to un-
dertaken assessments. The findings’ results have been recom-
mended to take into account the temporal features on predicting 
of subsequent assessments grades. 
Future research direction involves the use of temporal 
features for predicting students’ assessments grades model. 
With temporal feature time series analysis will be untaken, 
might be more advanced machine leering will be utilized."
