abstract
Predicting student attrition is an intriguing yet challenging problem for any academic institution. Class-
imbalanced data is a common in the ﬁeld of student retention, mainly because a lot of students register
but fewer students drop out. Classiﬁcation techniques for imbalanced dataset can yield deceivingly high
prediction accuracy where the overall predictive accuracy is usually driven by the majority class at the
expense of having very poor performance on the crucial minority class. In this study, we compared dif-
ferent data balancing techniques to improve the predictive accuracy in minority class while maintaining
satisfactory overall classiﬁcation performance. Speciﬁcally, we tested three balancing techniques—over-
sampling, under-sampling and synthetic minority over-sampling (SMOTE)—along with four popular clas-
siﬁcation methods—logistic regression, decision trees, neuron networks and support vector machines. We
used a large and feature rich institutional student data (between the years 2005 and 2011) to assess the
efﬁcacy of both balancing techniques as well as prediction methods. The results indicated that the sup-
port vector machine combined with SMOTE data-balancing technique achieved the best classiﬁcation
performance with a 90.24% overall accuracy on the 10-fold holdout sample. All three data-balancing tech-
niques improved the prediction accuracy for the minority class. Applying sensitivity analyses on devel-
oped models, we also identiﬁed the most important variables for accurate prediction of student
attrition. Application of these models has the potential to accurately predict at-risk students and help
reduce student dropout rates.

1. Introduction
Increasing the student retention is a long term goal of any uni-
versity in the US and around the world. The negative effects of stu-
dent attrition are evident to students, parents, university and the
society as a whole. The positive impact of increased retention is
also obvious: college graduates are more likely to have a better ca-
reer and have higher standard of life. College rankings, federal
funding agencies, state appropriation committees and program
accreditation agencies are all interested in student retention rates.
Higher the retention rate, more likely for the institution to be
ranked higher, secure more federal funds, traded favorably for
appropriation and have easier path to program accreditations. Be-
cause of all of these reasons, administrator in higher education
administrators are feeling increasingly more pressure to design
and implement strategic initiatives to increase student retention
rates. Furthermore, universities with high attrition rates face the
signiﬁcant loss of tuition, fees, and potential alumni contributions
(Scott, Spielmans, & Julka, 2004 ). A signiﬁcant portion of student
attrition happens in the ﬁrst year of college, also called the fresh-
men year. According to Delen (2011) , ﬁfty-percent or more of the
student attrition can be attributed to the ﬁrst year in the college.
Therefore, it is essential to identify vulnerable students who are
prone to dropping out in their freshmen year. Identiﬁcation of
the at-risk freshmen students can allow institutions to better and
faster progress towards achieving their retention management
goals.
Many modeling methods were found to assist institutions in
predicting at-risk students, planning for interventions, to better
understand and address fundamental issues causing student drop-
outs, and ultimately to increase the student retention rates. For
many years, traditional statistical methods have been used to pre-
dict students’ attrition and identify factors that correlate to their
academic behavior. The statistics based methods that are more fre-
quently used were logistic regression ( Lin, Imbrie, & Reid, 2009;
Scott et al., 2004; Zhang, Anderson, Ohland, & Thorndyke, 2004 ),

Therefore, it is essential to identify vulnerable students who are

the at-risk freshmen students can allow institutions to better and

Thammasiri et al. - 2014 - A critical assessment of imbalanced class distribution problem The case of predicting freshmen stud.pdf,"discriminant analysis ( Burtner, 2005 ) and structural equation
modeling (SEM) ( Li, Swaminathan, & Tang, 2009; Lin et al., 2009 ).
Recently, many researchers have focused on machine learning
and data mining techniques to study student retention phenome-
non in higher education. Alkhasawneh (2011) proposed a hybrid
model where he used artiﬁcial neural networks for performance
modeling and used genetic algorithms for selecting feature subset
in order to better predict the at-risk students and to obtain thor-
ough understanding of the factors that relate to ﬁrst year academic
success and retention of students at Virginia Commonwealth Uni-
versity. Delen (2010) used a large and rich freshmen student data,
along with several classiﬁcation methods to predict attrition, and
using sensitivity analysis, explained the factors that are contribut-
ing to the prediction models in a ranked order of importance. Yu,
DiGangi, Jannasch-Pennell, Lo, and Kaprolet (2007) conducted a
study where they used classiﬁcation trees for predicting attrition
and for identifying the most crucial factors contributing to reten-
tion. Zhang and Oussena (2010) proposed data mining as an ena-
bler to improve student retention in higher education. The goal
of their research was to identify potential problems as early as pos-
sible and to follow up with best possible intervention options to
enhance student retention. They built and tested several classiﬁca-
tion algorithms, including Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees and Support
Vector Machines. Their results showed that Naïve Bayes archived
the highest prediction accuracy while the Decision Tree with low-
est one.
This brief review of the previous studies shows that data mining
methods have a great potential to augment the traditional means
to better manage student retention. Compared to the traditional
statistical methods, they have fewer restrictions (e.g., normality,
independence, collinearity, etc.) and are capable of producing bet-
ter prediction accuracies. Particularly when working with large
data sets that contain many predictor variables, data mining meth-
ods proven to be robust in dealing with missing data, capturing
highly complex nonlinear patterns, and hence producing models
with very high level of prediction accuracy. Although, there is a
consensus on the use of data mining and machine learning tech-
niques, there is hardly any consensus on which data mining tech-
nique to use for the retention prediction problem. Literature has
shown superiority of different techniques over the other in variety
of different institutional settings. Depending on the data, and the
formulation of the problem, any data mining technique can come
out to be superior to any other. This lack of consensus prompts
an experimental approach to identifying and using the most appro-
priate data mining technique for a given prediction problem.
Therefore, in this study we developed and compared four different
data mining techniques.
In the retention datasets, there usually are relatively fewer in-
stances of students who have dropped out compared to the in-
stances of students who have persisted. This data characteristic
where the number of examples of one ﬂaw type (i.e., a class label)
is much higher than the others is known as the problem of imbal-
anced data, or the class imbalance problem. We found that in our
dataset, minority class samples constitutedonly about 21% of the-
complete dataset. According to Li and Sun (2012) if the proportion
of minority class samples constitutes less than 35% of the dataset,
the dataset is considered as imbalanced. Therefore, in this study we
are to deal with an imbalanced class distribution problem. The
class imbalance problem is not unique to student retention, it is
an intrinsic characteristics of many domains including credit scor-
ing ( Brown & Mues, 2012 ), prediction of liquefaction potential
(Yazdi, Kalantary, & Yazdi, 2012 ), bankruptcy prediction ( Olson,
Delen, & Meng, 2012 ) and biomedical document classiﬁcation
(Laza, Pavon, Reboiro-Jato, & Fedz-Riverola, 2011 ). It has been re-
ported in data mining research that when learning from imbal-
anced data, data mining algorithms tend to produce high
predictive accuracy over the majority class, but poor predictive
accuracy over the minority class. Learning from imbalanced data
thus becomes an important sub ﬁeld in data mining research. To
improve the accuracy of classiﬁcation methods with imbalanced
data, several methods have been previously studied. These meth-
ods could be considered as a data preprocessing that take place be-
fore applying the classiﬁcation methods. The methods to balance
imbalanced data sets employ some variant of under sampling
and/or over sampling of the original data sets.
In this research study, we developed and tested numerous pre-
diction models using different sampling strategies such as under-
sampling, over-sampling and SMOTE to handle imbalanced data.
Using four different modeling techniques—logistic regression, deci-
sion tree, neural networks and support vector machines—over four
different data structures—original, balanced with over-sampling,
balanced with under-sampling and balanced with SMOTE—we
wanted to understand the interrelationships among sampling
methods, classiﬁers and performance measures to predict student
retention data. In order to minimize the sampling bias in splitting
the data between training and testing for each model building
exercise, we utilized 10-fold cross validation. Overall, we executed
a4 /C2 4 /C2 10 experimental design that resulted in 160 unique clas-
siﬁcation models. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 provides a condensed literature review on student retention
and the class imbalance problem. Section 3 describes the freshmen
student dataset, and provides a brief review of the classiﬁcation
models, imbalance data techniques and evaluation metrics used
for our study. Section 4 presents and discusses the empirical re-
sults. Section 5, the ﬁnal section, concludes the paper with the list-
ing of the contributions and limitations of this study.
2. Literature review
In this section, we ﬁrst review the student retention problem
from theoretical perspective—concept and theoretical models of
student retention—and then review it from analytic perspective
where machine learning and data mining techniques are used for
classiﬁcation of student attrition. In the second part of the section,
we reviewed the literature on the methods used for handling class
imbalance problem.
2.1. Student retention
There are two types of outcomes in student retention: typical
stayer is a student enrolled each semester until graduation and
graduates in due course plan; a dropout, or leaver, is a student
who enters university but leaves prematurely or drop out before
graduation and never returns to study again. High rates of student
attrition have been reported in the reality of college readiness 2012
(see act.org).
Over the last several decades, researchers have developed the
most comprehensive models (theoretical as well as analytic) to ad-
dress higher education student retention problem. Earlier studies
dealt with understanding the reasons behind student attrition by
developing theoretical models. Undoubtedly the most famous re-
searcher in this area is Tinto (1987). His student engagement mod-
el has served as the foundation for hundreds of other theoretical
studies. Later, in addition to understanding the underlying reasons,
the researchers have been interested in identifying at-risk students
as early as possible so that they can prevent the likelihood of drop-
ping out. Early identiﬁcation of the students with higher risk of
dropping out provides the means for the administrators to insti-
gate intervention programs, provide assistance for those students
in need. In earlier analytical approaches, traditional statistical
methods such as logistic regression, discriminant analysis and

Thammasiri et al. - 2014 - A critical assessment of imbalanced class distribution problem The case of predicting freshmen stud.pdf,"structural equation modeling (SEM) were used most frequently in
retention studies to identify factors and their contributions to the
student dropout. Glynn, Sauer, and Miller (2002) developed the lo-
gistic regression model to provide early identiﬁcation of freshmen
at risk of attrition. The early identiﬁcation is accomplished literally
within a couple of weeks after freshman orientation. The model
and its results were presented along with a brief description to
the institutional intervention program designed to enhance stu-
dent persistence. Luna (2000) used logistic regression, discrimi-
nant analysis, and classiﬁcation and regression trees (CART).
Focusing on new, incoming freshmen, this study examined several
variables to see which can provide information about retention and
academic outcome after three semesters. Scott et al. (2004) con-
ducted a study which used a multiple linear regression to examine
potential psychosocial predictors of freshman academic achieve-
ment and retention. This study demonstrated the utility of model
to predict academic achievement but not college student retention.
They suggested that future research should consider other psycho-
social factors that might predict freshman retention. Pyke and
Sheridan (1993) proposed a logistic regression analysis to predict
the retention of master’s and doctoral candidates at a Canadian
university. Results for master’s students indicate that analytic-dri-
ven interventions signiﬁcantly improved the student’s chances of
graduating with the degree.
Some of the student retention research focused on students’
academic experience and its derivatives. For instance, Schreiner
(2009) conducted a research where he empirically linked student
satisfaction to retention, postulating on the widespread belief that
there is indeed a positive relationship between the two. His models
focused on determining whether student satisfaction is predictive
of retention the following year. A logistic regression analysis was
conducted on each class level separately, using actual enrollment
status as the dependent variable. Their results indicated that the
ﬁrst-year students whom do not ﬁnd college enjoyable are 60% less
likely to return as sophomores; while those with the sense of lack
of belonging are 39% less likely, and those with difﬁculty of con-
tacting their advisor are 17% less likely to return. On a related
study, Garton and Ball (2002) conducted a research study to deter-
mine predictors of academic performance and retention of fresh-
men in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources
(CAFNR) at the University of Missouri. Using the step-wise discrim-
inant analysis method they built predictive models to determine
whether a linear combination of student experience along with
learning style, ACT score, high school class rank, and high school
core GPA could determine the likelihood of persistence. In their lin-
ear models, high school core GPA was the best predictor of college
academic performance for freshmen students. Furthermore, learn-
ing style was not a signiﬁcant predictor of students’ academic per-
formance during their ﬁrst year of enrollment in the college of
agriculture. The traditional criteria used for college admission
was found to have limited value in predicting agriculture students’
retention.
Recently, machine learning and data mining techniques are
gaining popularity in modeling and predicting student attrition.
Yu, DiGangi, Jannasch-Pennell, and Kaprolet (2010) shown that
their research attempts brought in a new perspective by exploring
this issue with the use of three data mining techniques, namely,
classiﬁcation trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines
(MARS), and neural networks; resulting in relatively better predic-
tion models that identiﬁed transferred hours, residency, and eth-
nicity as crucial factors in determining student attrition. Lin
(2012) also used a data mining approach to build predictive mod-
els for student retention management. His models aimed at identi-
fying students who are in need of support from the student
retention program using a variety of prediction models. The results
show that some of the machine learning algorithms were able to
establish reasonably good predictive models from the existing stu-
dent retention data. Nandeshwar, Menzies, and Nelson (2011)
studied to use data mining to ﬁnd patterns of student retention
at American Universities. They applied various attributes selection
methods including CFS, Information Gain, chi-squared, and One-R
to identify the ranked order importance of the independent vari-
ables. The researchers tested various classiﬁers such as One-R,
C4.5, ADTrees, Naive Bayes, Bayes networks, and radial bias net-
works to create models for predicting student retention. Data used
in this study were from a mid-size public university. After deter-
mining the subset of the attributes that best predict for student
retention, the researchers conducted a contrast a set of experi-
ments to seek attributes (values and ranges) that are most discrim-
inative in various outcomes. They found that the rankings of all
attribute ranges which, in isolation, predict for third year retention
at a probability higher than the ZeroR limit (55%), and are sup-
ported by good number of records. The top six attributes most sig-
niﬁcant of third-year retention were the ﬁnancial aid hypothesis:
student’s wages, parent’s adjusted gross income, student’s ad-
justed gross income, mother’s in-come, father’s income, and high
school percentile.
In a more recent study, Lauría, Baron, Devireddy, Sundararaju,
and Jayaprakash (2012) used a fall 2010 undergraduate students
data from four different sources including students’ biographic
data and course related data; course management (Sakai—Sakai-
Project.org) event data and Sakai’s grade book data. They used
oversampling to balance the data and applied three classiﬁers for
prediction and comparison purposes. The models included logistic
regression, support vector machines, and C4.5 decision trees. The
result show that the logistic regression and the SVM algorithms
provide higher classiﬁcation accuracy than the C4.5 decision tree
in terms of their ability to detect students at academic risk. Some
of the other noteworthy recent studies in this domain include Ko-
vacˇic´, 2012; Yadav and Pal (2012), Yadav, Bharadwaj, and Pal
(2012) among others. They all have used limited data sets with a
wide range of machine learning techniques, ﬁnding somewhat dif-
ferent sets of predictors as the most important indicators of reten-
tion. Table 1 provides a tabular representation of some of the
recent student retention studies and their data balancing and pre-
diction model speciﬁcations. As the table clearly indicates, the class
imbalance problem is not explicitly addressed in these studies (i.e.,
either not perceived as a signiﬁcant problem or is not clearly ex-
plained in the article). The next sub-section provides a more detail
about the class imbalance problem and its impact of the validity
and value of prediction models.
2.2. The class imbalance problem
Imbalanced data problem is quite usual in machine learning
and data mining applications as it appears in many real-world pre-
diction tasks. However, the techniques and concept of balancing
the data prior to model building is relatively new to many informa-
tion systems researchers. A wide variety of balancing techniques
have been applied to data sets in many areas such as medical diag-
nosis (Li, Liu, & Hu, 2010; Su, Chen, & Yih 2006 ), classiﬁers for data-
base marketing ( Duman, Ekinci, & Tanriverdi, 2012 ), property
reﬁnance prediction ( Gong & Huang, 2012 ), classiﬁcation of weld
ﬂaws ( Liao, 2008 ) among others. In the class imbalance problems,
the ‘‘imbalance’’ can be described as the number of instances in at
least one class signiﬁcantly outnumbering the other classes. We
call the classes having more of the number of samples as the
majority classes and the ones having fewer the number of samples
as the minority classes. In such case, standard classiﬁer algorithms
usually have a bias towards the majority class ( Xu & Chow, 2006;
Zhou & Liu, 2006 ). These cases are shown in Fig. 1 , where in the
balanced data the accuracy over the minority class signiﬁcantly in-

gistic regression model to provide early identiﬁcation of freshmen
at risk of attrition. The early identiﬁcation is accomplished literally
within a couple of weeks after freshman orientation. The model
and its results were presented along with a brief description to
the institutional intervention program designed to enhance stu-
dent persistence. Luna (2000) used logistic regression, discrimi-
nant analysis, and classiﬁcation and regression trees (CART).
Focusing on new, incoming freshmen, this study examined several
variables to see which can provide information about retention and
academic outcome after three semesters. Scott et al. (2004) con-
ducted a study which used a multiple linear regression to examine
potential psychosocial predictors of freshman academic achieve-
ment and retention. This study demonstrated the utility of model
to predict academic achievement but not college student retention.
They suggested that future research should consider other psycho-
social factors that might predict freshman retention. Pyke and
Sheridan (1993) proposed a logistic regression analysis to predict
the retention of master’s and doctoral candidates at a Canadian
university. Results for master’s students indicate that analytic-dri-
ven interventions signiﬁcantly improved the student’s chances of
graduating with the degree.
Some of the student retention research focused on students’
academic experience and its derivatives. For instance, Schreiner
(2009) conducted a research where he empirically linked student
satisfaction to retention, postulating on the widespread belief that
there is indeed a positive relationship between the two. His models
focused on determining whether student satisfaction is predictive
of retention the following year. A logistic regression analysis was
conducted on each class level separately, using actual enrollment
status as the dependent variable. Their results indicated that the
ﬁrst-year students whom do not ﬁnd college enjoyable are 60% less
likely to return as sophomores; while those with the sense of lack
of belonging are 39% less likely, and those with difﬁculty of con-
tacting their advisor are 17% less likely to return. On a related
study, Garton and Ball (2002) conducted a research study to deter-
mine predictors of academic performance and retention of fresh-
men in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources
(CAFNR) at the University of Missouri. Using the step-wise discrim-
inant analysis method they built predictive models to determine
whether a linear combination of student experience along with
learning style, ACT score, high school class rank, and high school
core GPA could determine the likelihood of persistence. In their lin-
ear models, high school core GPA was the best predictor of college
academic performance for freshmen students. Furthermore, learn-
ing style was not a signiﬁcant predictor of students’ academic per-
formance during their ﬁrst year of enrollment in the college of
agriculture. The traditional criteria used for college admission
was found to have limited value in predicting agriculture students’
retention.
Recently, machine learning and data mining techniques are
gaining popularity in modeling and predicting student attrition.
Yu, DiGangi, Jannasch-Pennell, and Kaprolet (2010) shown that
their research attempts brought in a new perspective by exploring
this issue with the use of three data mining techniques, namely,
classiﬁcation trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines
(MARS), and neural networks; resulting in relatively better predic-
tion models that identiﬁed transferred hours, residency, and eth-
nicity as crucial factors in determining student attrition. Lin
(2012) also used a data mining approach to build predictive mod-
els for student retention management. His models aimed at identi-
fying students who are in need of support from the student
retention program using a variety of prediction models. The results
show that some of the machine learning algorithms were able to
establish reasonably good predictive models from the existing stu-
dent retention data. Nandeshwar, Menzies, and Nelson (2011)
studied to use data mining to ﬁnd patterns of student retention
at American Universities. They applied various attributes selection
methods including CFS, Information Gain, chi-squared, and One-R
to identify the ranked order importance of the independent vari-
ables. The researchers tested various classiﬁers such as One-R,
C4.5, ADTrees, Naive Bayes, Bayes networks, and radial bias net-
works to create models for predicting student retention. Data used
in this study were from a mid-size public university. After deter-
mining the subset of the attributes that best predict for student
retention, the researchers conducted a contrast a set of experi-
ments to seek attributes (values and ranges) that are most discrim-
inative in various outcomes. They found that the rankings of all
attribute ranges which, in isolation, predict for third year retention
at a probability higher than the ZeroR limit (55%), and are sup-
ported by good number of records. The top six attributes most sig-
niﬁcant of third-year retention were the ﬁnancial aid hypothesis:
student’s wages, parent’s adjusted gross income, student’s ad-
justed gross income, mother’s in-come, father’s income, and high
school percentile.
In a more recent study, Lauría, Baron, Devireddy, Sundararaju,
and Jayaprakash (2012) used a fall 2010 undergraduate students
data from four different sources including students’ biographic
data and course related data; course management (Sakai—Sakai-
Project.org) event data and Sakai’s grade book data. They used
oversampling to balance the data and applied three classiﬁers for
prediction and comparison purposes. The models included logistic
regression, support vector machines, and C4.5 decision trees. The
result show that the logistic regression and the SVM algorithms
provide higher classiﬁcation accuracy than the C4.5 decision tree
in terms of their ability to detect students at academic risk. Some
of the other noteworthy recent studies in this domain include Ko-
vacˇic´, 2012; Yadav and Pal (2012), Yadav, Bharadwaj, and Pal
(2012) among others. They all have used limited data sets with a
wide range of machine learning techniques, ﬁnding somewhat dif-
ferent sets of predictors as the most important indicators of reten-
tion. Table 1 provides a tabular representation of some of the
recent student retention studies and their data balancing and pre-
diction model speciﬁcations. As the table clearly indicates, the class
imbalance problem is not explicitly addressed in these studies (i.e.,
either not perceived as a signiﬁcant problem or is not clearly ex-
plained in the article). The next sub-section provides a more detail
about the class imbalance problem and its impact of the validity
and value of prediction models.
2.2. The class imbalance problem
Imbalanced data problem is quite usual in machine learning
and data mining applications as it appears in many real-world pre-
diction tasks. However, the techniques and concept of balancing
the data prior to model building is relatively new to many informa-
tion systems researchers. A wide variety of balancing techniques
have been applied to data sets in many areas such as medical diag-
nosis (Li, Liu, & Hu, 2010; Su, Chen, & Yih 2006 ), classiﬁers for data-
base marketing ( Duman, Ekinci, & Tanriverdi, 2012 ), property
reﬁnance prediction ( Gong & Huang, 2012 ), classiﬁcation of weld
ﬂaws ( Liao, 2008 ) among others. In the class imbalance problems,
the ‘‘imbalance’’ can be described as the number of instances in at
least one class signiﬁcantly outnumbering the other classes. We
call the classes having more of the number of samples as the
majority classes and the ones having fewer the number of samples
as the minority classes. In such case, standard classiﬁer algorithms
usually have a bias towards the majority class ( Xu & Chow, 2006;
Zhou & Liu, 2006 ). These cases are shown in Fig. 1 , where in the
balanced data the accuracy over the minority class signiﬁcantly in-"
Thammasiri et al. - 2014 - A critical assessment of imbalanced class distribution problem The case of predicting freshmen stud.pdf,"creases while the accuracy over the majority one slightly de-
creases. Class imbalance usually degrades the real performance
of a classiﬁcation algorithm, by poorly predicting the minority
class which is often the center of attention for a classiﬁcation
problem.
Many researchers have focused on the class imbalance problem
in order to improve the prediction accuracy over the minority
class. Some of these methods used a pre-processing approach,
where they tried to balance the data before the model building,
while others developed prediction algorithms that assign different
weighting schemas to even-out class representations. The pre-pro-
cessing approach seem to be the more straight forward approach
that has greater promise to overcome class imbalance problem.
This approach uses various methods to either randomly oversam-
ple the minority class or randomly under-sample the majority class
(or some combination of the two). Random oversampling aims to
balance class populations through creating new samples (from
minority class by random selection) and adding them to the train-
ing set. On the other hand random under-sampling aims to balance
the class populations through removing data samples from the
majority class, until the classes are approximately equally repre-
sented. Even though there is no overwhelming evidence, the per-
formances of under-sampling technique are thought to
outperform the over-sampling technique ( Drummond & Holte,
2003).
Although data balancing techniques are known to improve pre-
diction results over the original data set, they have several impor-
tant drawbacks. Namely, random over-sampling technique
increases the size of the data set and therefore ampliﬁes the com-
putational burden. Random under-sampling may lead to lots of
important information when examples of the majority class are
randomly discarded from the original data set. Our brief review
on recent research studies has revealed that the coverage on data
balancing techniques is gaining more attention. There have been
many research attempts to develop techniques to better balance
the imbalance datasets prior to developing prediction models;
these techniques are often derived from either over- or under-sam-
pling some approached, such as SMOTE ( Chawla, Bowyer, Hall, &
Kegelmeyer, 2002 ), Borderline-SMOTE ( Han, Wang, & Mao, 2005 ),
Cluster-Based sampling ( Taeho & Nathalie, 2004 ), Adaptive Syn-
thetic Sampling algorithms ( Haibo, Yang, Garcia, & Shutao, 2008 ),
SMOTEBoost ( Chawla, Lazarevic, Hall, & Bowyer, 2003 ), Data-
Boost-IM ( Guo & Viktor, 2004 ).
3. Methodology
In this study, four popular classiﬁcation methods—artiﬁcial
neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees and lo-
gistic regression—along with three balancing techniques—random
over-sampling, random under-sampling and SMOTE—are used to
build prediction models, and compared to each other using 10-fold
cross validation hold-out samples. As a result, in this study, we
built 16 different types of classiﬁcation models (each containing
10 experimental models), which are named and listed in Table 2 .
The classiﬁcation performance measures are calculated using a
10-fold cross validation methodology. In this experimentation
methodology the dataset is ﬁrst partitioned into 10 roughly
equal-sized distinct subsets. For each experiment nine subsets
are used for training and the one part is used for testing. This pro-
cedure is repeated for 10 times for each of the 16 model types.
Then test results are aggregates to portray the ‘‘unbiased’’ estimate
of the model’s performance. As shown in Eq. (1), the performance
measure (PM) is averaged over k-folds (in this experimentation we
set the value of k to 10). In the Eq. (1), CV stands for cross-valida-
tion, k is the number of folds used, and PM is the performance mea-
sure for each fold ( Olson & Delen, 2008 )

set consisted of 34 variables and 21,654 examples/records, of
which 17,050 were positive/retained (78.7%) and 4,604 were neg-
ative/dropped-out (21.3%). A brief summary of the number of re-
cords by year is given in Table 3 . We performed a rigorous data
preprocessing to handle anomalies, unexplainable outliers and
missing values. For instance, we removed all of the international
student records from the freshmen dataset (which was less than
4% of the total dataset) because they did not contain some of the
presumed important predictors (e.g., high school GPA, SAT scores,
among others).
The data contained variables related to student’s academic,
ﬁnancial, and demographic characteristics. A complete list of vari-
ables obtained from the student databases is given in Table 4 .
3.2. Classiﬁcation methods
This study aims to compare the performance of four popular
classiﬁcation techniques within the student retention context.
What follows is a short description of these four classiﬁcation
techniques.
3.2.1. Artiﬁcial neuron networks
Artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) is a computationally-intensive
algorithmic procedure that transforms inputs into desired outputs
using highly inter-connected networks of relatively simple pro-
cessing elements (often called neurons, units or nodes). Neural net-
works are modeled after the neural activity in the human brain.
Different network structures are proposed over the last few dec-
ades. For classiﬁcation type problems (as is the case in this study),
the most commonly used structure is called multi-layered percep-
tron (MLP). In MLP the network architecture consists of three lay-
ers of neurons (input, hidden and output) connected by weights,
where the input of each neuron is the weighted sum of the net-
work inputs, and the output of the neuron is a function (sigmoid
or linear) value based on its inputs.
3.2.2. Support vector machines
Support vector machines (SVM) belong to a family of general-
ized linear models which achieves a classiﬁcation model based
on the linear combination of independent variables. The mapping
function in SVM can be either a classiﬁcation function (as is the
case in this study) or a regression function. For classiﬁcation, non-
linear kernel functions are often used to transform the input data
(inherently representing highly complex nonlinear relationships)
to a high dimensional feature space in which the input data be-
comes more separable (i.e., linearly separable) compared to the ori-
ginal input space. Then, the maximum-margin hyperplanes are
constructed to optimally separate the classes in the training data.
The assumption is that the larger the margin or distance between
these hyperplanes the better the generalization performance of the
classiﬁer. SVM are gain in popularity of being an excellent alterna-
tive to ANNs for prediction type problems.
3.2.3. Decision trees
Decision trees (DT) aim to predict discrete-valued target func-
tions, where the learned function that connects the predictor vari-
ables to the predicted variable is represented by a decision tree
(Mitchell, 1977 ). Decision tree algorithm uses a divide-and-concur
methodology to ﬁnd most discriminating variables and variable-
values to create a tree-looking structure that is composed of nodes
and edges. The main difference between different DT algorithms is
the heuristic (Gini Index, Information Gain, Entropy, Chi-square,
etc.) that they used to identify the most discriminating variable
and variable-values. In this study, we used a popular decision tree
algorithm (C5), which is an improved version of ID# and C4.5 algo-
rithms developed by Quinlan (1986) .

minority class.
3.3.2. Random over-sampling (RUS)
This method randomly select examples from the minority class
with replacement until the number of selected examples plus the
original examples of the minority class is roughly equal to that of
the majority class.
3.3.3. Synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE)
This heuristic, originally developed by Chawla et al. (2002) , gen-
erates synthetic minority examples to be added to the original
dataset. For each minority example, its k nearest neighbors of the
same class is found. Some of these nearest neighbors are then ran-
domly selected according to the over-sampling rate. A new syn-
thetic example is generated along the line between the minority
example and every one of its selected nearest neighbors. This pro-
cess is repeated until the number of examples in all classes is
roughly equal to each other.
3.4. Evaluation measures
To evaluate the performance of 16 classiﬁcation methods, we
used a number of popular metrics. These metrics are calculated
using the confusion matrixes (see Table 5 ). Confusion matrix is a
unique tabulation of correctly and incorrectly predicted examples
for each class. For a binary classiﬁcation problem, there are four
populated cells: True Positives (TP)—denote the number of positive
examples that were predicted correctly, True Negatives (TN)—de-
note the number of negative examples that were predicted cor-
rectly, False Positives (FP)—denote the number of positive
examples that were predicted incorrectly, and False Negatives
(FN)—denote the number of negatives examples that were pre-
dicted incorrectly.

the average accuracy, sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the classiﬁcation

5. Discussion and conclusion
In this paper, we described our approach to the construction of
classiﬁers from imbalanced datasets. A dataset is imbalanced if the
classes (i.e., classiﬁcation categories) are not nearly equally repre-
sented. Most real-world data sets are imbalanced, containing a
large number of regular/expected examples with only a small per-
centage of irregular/unexpected examples. Often, what is interest-
ing is the recognition/prediction of the irregular/unexpected
examples. Machine learning techniques are not very good at dis-
cerning/predicting less representative class in imbalanced data-
sets. Therefore a data balancing task is needed as part of the data
preprocessing phase. In this study, we compared three data balanc-
ing techniques using four popular classiﬁcation methods along
with a large feature-rich real-world data set.
To succeed, college student retention projects should follow a
multi-phased process, which may starts with identifying, storing
(in a databases), and using student data/characteristics to better
understand underlying reason and to predict the at-risk students
who are more likely to dropout, and ends with developing effective
and efﬁcient intervention methods to retain them. In such a pro-
cess, analytics can play the most crucial role of accurately identify-
ing students with the highest propensity to drop-out as well as
explaining the factors underlying the phenomenon. Because ma-
chine learning methods (such as the ones used in this study) are
capable of modeling highly nonlinear relationships, they are be-
lieved to be more appropriate techniques to predict the complex
nature of student attrition with a high level of accuracy.
The results of this study show that, if proper methods of prepro-
cessing applied to sufﬁciently large data sets with the rich set of
variables, analytics methods are capable of predicting freshmen
student attrition with high level of accuracy (as high as 90%).
SMOTE balancing technique combined with support vector ma-
chine classiﬁcation method provided the highest overall perfor-
mance (i.e., prediction accuracy, correlation coefﬁcient and G-
mean). From the usability standpoint, despite the fact that SVM
and ANN had better prediction results, one might chose to use
decision trees because compared to SVM and ANN, they portray
a more transparent model structure. Decision trees explicitly show
the reasoning process of different prediction outcomes, providing a
justiﬁcation for a speciﬁc prediction, whereas SVM and ANN are
mathematical models that do not provide such a transparent view
of how they do what they do.
A noteworthy strength of this study is that it provides a rank-
ordered importance of the features used in the perdition modeling.
Speciﬁcally, sensitivity analysis is applied to prediction models to
identify their comparative importance (i.e., additive contribution)
in predicting the output variable. The sensitivity values of all vari-
ables across all 16 model types are aggregated to construct the ﬁ-
nal list of variable-value pairs. Such an understanding not only
help build more parsimonious models, but also helps decision
makers understand what variables are the most important in
improving retention rates.
The success of analytics project relies heavily on the richness
(quantity and dimensionality) of the data representing the phe-
nomenon being considered. Even though this study used a large
sample of data (covering several years of freshmen student re-
cords) with a rather rich set of features, more data and more vari-
ables can potentially help improve the analytics/prediction results.
Some of the variables that have a great potential to improve pre-
diction performance include student’s social interaction/connect-
edness (being a member of a fraternity or other social groups);
student’s parent’s or signiﬁcant others educational and ﬁnancial
backgrounds, and student’s prior expectation/ambitions from his
educational endeavors.
Potential future directions of this study include (i) extending
the predictive modeling methods to include ensembles (model
combining/fusing techniques), (ii) enhancing the information
