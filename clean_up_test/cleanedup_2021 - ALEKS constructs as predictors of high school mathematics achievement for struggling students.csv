ABSTRACT
The purpose of this study was to determine what factors of the Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces
(ALEKS), an ITS, are predictive of struggling learners’ performance in a blended-learning Algebra 1 course at an
inner city technical high school located in the northeastern U.S. Three variables (student retention, engagement
time, and the ratio of topics mastered to topics practiced) were used to predict the degree of association on the
criterion variable (mathematics competencies), as measured byﬁnal course progress grades in algebra, and the
Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Test (PSATm) math scores. A correlational predictive design was applied to
assess the data of a purposive sample of 265 struggling students at the study site; multiple regression analysis was
also used to investigate the predictability of these variables. Findings suggest that engagement time and the ratio
of mastered to practiced topics were signiﬁcant predictors ofﬁnal course progress grades. Nevertheless, these
factors were not signiﬁcant contributors in predicting PSATm score. Retention was identiﬁed as the only statis-
tically signiﬁcant predictor of PSATm score. The results offer educators with additional insights that can facilitate
improvements in mathematical content knowledge and promote higher graduation rates for struggling learners in
high school mathematics.
1. Introduction
Educationalists view mathematics as one of the most difﬁcult subjects
to master in education, and many individuals across the United States
demonstrate challenges with attaining proﬁciency in mathematics con-
cepts and skills. U.S. high school graduates are among these non-
proﬁcient math learners, with many requiring remediation in higher
education, according toJohnson and Samora (2016). The rapid infusion
of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) in high school mathematics courses
has provided educators with unprecedented opportunities to engage
learners in active learning (Dani, 2016; Fine et al., 2009; Icoz et al., 2015;
Liu, Rogers and Pardo, 2015b) and potentially address nonproﬁciency
issues. Such online learning platforms aid teachers with assessing,
instructing, monitoring, modifying, and differentiating instruction to
address the diverse needs of students.
Nonetheless, many learners at risk of failing high school mathematics
continue to experience difﬁculties in such milieus (Gasevic et al., 2016;
McManis and McManis, 2016 ). Their lack of self-management and
self-regulation skills exacerbates the challenges these students face in
these settings. It is therefore imperative that stakeholders are aware of
effective supports that inﬂuence the achievement of struggling learners
in these learning platforms. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to

(ALEKS) on struggling students' achievement in a high school Algebra 1
course and to determine what ITS program variables are the best pre-
dictors to support these learners' success in this arena. Suchﬁndings may
inform effective interventions to maximize struggling learners’ perfor-
mance in similar learning environments now and in the future.
1.1. Background
Technological advancements have contributed to the increased
application of computer-based instruction and adaptive tutors to aid the
success of learners in the United States. Of these systems, intelligent tu-
tors have been the most frequently applied in recent years (Kulik and
Fletcher, 2016). These tutoring and assessment systems are capable of
identifying and gauging individualized learning. Elnajjar and Naser
(2017) asserted that adaptive techniques af ﬁliated with ITS shows
promise in supporting the learning of students in blended settings (a
combination of in-person and e-learning methods). These systems
incorporate cognitive theories along with artiﬁcial intelligence to infer
students’ knowledge (Johnson and Samora, 2016; Kulik and Fletcher,
2016) as well as make intelligent decision to coach them toward
improved learning. Educationalists incorporated these programs in
blended-learning settings to determine what students know and to
motivate and engage them in rigorous activities that would enhance their
performance outcomes.
Educators incorporate ITSs in blended settings to assist the teaching
and learning processes, promote diversiﬁcation, and to foster andragogic
practices for learning. Such application provides educationalists with
encouraging outlooks for the use of one-to-one learning devices (Johnson
and Samora, 2016) to facilitate independent learning and differentiated
instruction. Accordingly, a growing number of learners are being exposed
to ITSs on a yearly basis (Chen and Yao, 2016). These students are
required to demonstrate self-management and self-regulation skills to
facilitate their progress in these settings. Nonetheless, the
blended-learning arena has provided instructors with challenges in
managing and promoting struggling learners. The heuristics that educa-
tors require to assess students' disengagement are not readily available or
easily transferable in the online platform (Liu et al., 2015a). Still, the
recent ﬁelds of education data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA)
have optimized the potential for improved knowledge and understanding
of such behaviors. Through advancements in theseﬁelds, practitioners
are able to measure and analyzed large amounts of students behavioral
data from ITS databases to garner greater insights related to students'
who are at risk for failure in these online modalities, and to develop and
apply modiﬁcations to improve their performance in these settings
(Gasevic et al., 2016; Holstein et al., 2017; Icoz et al., 2015; Liu et al.,
2015a, 2015b; San Pedro, 2017). Accordingly, educators view these new
developments in teaching and learning models as a panacea for
despondent results (Johnson and Samora, 2016) in struggling students’
mathematical achievement across the United States.
However, few researchers have conducted studies to assess the effect
of ITS adaptive instruction on high school students' mathematics
achievement or identify ITS variables that are most effective at predicting
these learners’ success in blended-learning mathematics courses at the
secondary level. A few of these investigations suggest a need for further
evaluation of ITS and various system factors (including time on ITS
content information) that might improve the effectiveness of the indi-
vidualized teaching and learning processes (Dani, 2016; Icoz et al., 2015;
San Pedro, 2017).
1.2. ALEKS
The ALEKS web-based program is an ITS that is designed to apply
mathematical instruction and ongoing assessments to monitor and
manage students' knowledge acquisition. Similar to other ITSs, the
computer platform gathers data related to learners' working behavior
pattern and provides appropriate feedback and guidance to support their
learning needs (Dani, 2016). Educationalists can obtain and apply this
data to differentiate instruction to address the needs of students. The
program provides learners with (1) individualized sequence of problems
to solve, (2) implements knowledge checks to assess their understanding
(implemented continuously and at the end of course goals), and (3)
guidance via instructional practice review to promote learning and un-
derstanding of problem-solving skills (McGraw-Hills, 2017). Nonethe-
less, ALEKS provides the same level of instruction to all students
irrespective of their diverse learning styles and provides instructors with
the opportunity to upload external video presentations to assist students’
visual and auditory learning demands (Dani and Nasser, 2016).
The ALEKS software program uses a curriculum-based approach
(Johnson and Samora, 2016) which minimizes adjustments to school
districts' curriculum practices. Hence, educators can apply ALEKS in
blended settings to deliver an entire mathematics curriculum via indi-
vidualized instruction ( McGraw Hill Education, 2017b ); and apply
problems that are within the learners Zone of Proximal Development
(ZPD) to facilitate the knowledge, skills, and behavior that promotes
conceptual understanding (Dani and Nasser, 2016) and mathematical
thinking. Similar to most ITSs for numeracy, program developers created
ALEKS to address the current problems relevant to students' mathemat-
ical achievement. Educators at the postsecondary level of instruction
apply this ITS to improve the remediation problems associated with
learning mathematics (Johnson and Samora, 2016) and to promote
competency-based education at the K-12 level of education. However,
unlike other ITSs that provides procedural step-by-step guidance when
completing a problem, ALEKS only provide feedback on theﬁnal answer
(Dani, 2016; Dani and Nasser, 2016). Dani (2016) asserted that the
inability for students to demonstrate strategies for problem-solving
within the ALEKS program may limit the software's capability to mea-
sure meta-cognition for learning.
The body of research on the effectiveness of the ALEKS software
program is limited. Most of these investigations center on the impact of
ALEKS on students' math achievements at the postsecondary level.
Nonetheless, recent studies have been growing at the secondary levels of
instruction and results have been mixed. Several of these studies show
promising effects related to the ALEKS ITS on struggling students’ math
achievement.
For example, a pilot study was instituted byHu et al. (2012) to
investigate the effectiveness of the ALEKS ITS on improving the mathe-
matical skills of struggling sixth-grade students in an after-school setting.
The participants included 266 sixth-grade students and four math in-
structors who were randomly assigned to an ALEKS centered or a
teacher-centered condition. The researchers applied a state standardized
assessment to measure student performance outcomes, and a t-test
analysis and multiple regression evaluations to analyze pre- and
post-standardized test scores and ALEKS data logs. The results indicated
no signiﬁcant differences between pre- and post-standardized test scores.
However, the regression examination predicted 29% of the observed
variance for students' post-standardized test scores. These ﬁndings
revealed that higher post-test scores were predicted by participants’
pre-test scores, attendance, and gender; while experimental treatment
and race reported insigniﬁcant results.
Brasiel et al. (2016)conducted a mixed method study with the use of
a quasi-experimental and survey design to assess the impact of 11
computer-assisted instruction (CAI) mathematical software programs on
student achievement gains. The exploration included 200,000 K-12 stu-
dents who participated in the quasi-experimental method and 2,933 in-
structors who completed survey responses. This study was the ﬁrst
assessment of a 2-year impact inquiry. A state standardized assessment
was applied as a measure of student achievement performance. The au-
thors used a baseline comparison and logistic regression analysis to
analyze quantitative data and a thematic approach was instituted to
assess survey responses. The investigators identiﬁed six products that

dalities (ALEKS and iReady) that demonstrate statistically signiﬁcant
achievement variations (p < .05). Further results indicated that teachers
were satisﬁed with the technologies ability to manage performance as-
sessments and engage and empower students in learning activities.
Nonetheless, obstacles related to teacher attitude and experience with
technology, and infrastructure relevant to these platforms, were noted by
the researchers.
Sullins et al. (2013)applied an examination to determine if individ-
ualized instruction in the ALEKS ITS will increase students' performance
on a state standardized assessment. The researchers solicited middle
school students (from grades 6, 7, and 8) who participate in a supple-
mental application of the ALEKS ITS during the academic year. The au-
thors conducted two studies. The objective of theﬁrst study was to
identify if mastery of ALEKS goal topics correlated with success on the
Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program, a state standardized
assessment. The second study replicated and expands on theﬁndings
from theﬁrst study and included a new sample from a different district. A
total of 218 students from two school districts participated in theﬁrst
study. The practitioners instituted a correlation analysis to compare the
percentage of students' mastered topics in ALEKS with achievement
scores. The results indicated a positive and statistically signiﬁcant rela-
tionship between both scores at each grade level. Speciﬁcally, the re-
searchers identiﬁed a signiﬁcant positive correlation between the ALEKS
mathematical categories measure and learners’ standardized mathe-
matics category measures (including Numbers and Operations, Algebraic
Thinking, Graphs and Graphing, Data Analysis and Processing, Mea-
surement, and Geometry).
The second study that was carried out bySullins et al. (2013)assessed
the relationship across and within grade levels. This examination
involved 321 middle school students (from grades 5, 6, and 7) and
included those measures applied in theﬁrst study. The results conﬁrmed
the ﬁndings of study 1 and revealed a positive statistically signiﬁcant
correlation between and within these scores. The authors suggest that
students’ proﬁciency in ALEKS can be a potential predictor of future
performance on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment measure. The
researchers did caution these results based on the lack of rigorous anal-
ysis and methodology within the research.
A more recent study that was carried out byBrasiel et al. (2016)used
a mixed-method study to evaluate the effectiveness of 11 online mathe-
matics educational technology products on the achievements of 200,000
K-12 students during the 2014-15 academic year. The practitioners
applied a quasi-experimental design and a qualitative self-reported sur-
vey to address the research questions. The participants were separated
into a technology group (with one-to-one application) and a traditional
instructional (business-as-usual) group. The results from the logistic
regression analysis of 44, 497 students favored the use of the techno-
logical products, and the ALEKS ITS was identiﬁed as one of the programs
that demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant positive impact on struggling
students' achievement. The survey data were obtained from 2, 933
teachers and a thematic approach was incorporated to identify com-
monalities. Teachers overall response to the use of the technology in the
classroom was positive. Theﬁndings indicated that 57% of the teachers
were satis
ﬁed with the software products and 10% were satisﬁed with
their students' engagement when using these modalities. However, only
34% of the instructors reported using the performance management
features within the products to monitor students’ progress. The authors
reﬂected disappointment at the small percentage of responders who
applied the management feature to support students and guide instruc-
tion as this was one of the primary function of the mathematical
platforms.
In contrast to the aboveﬁndings, some researchers postulate that
ALEKS provides minimal to no advantage to learning in traditional
classrooms. Craig et al. (2013) reported insigniﬁcant ﬁnding in their
experimental study that assessed the effectiveness of the ALEKS ITS on
improving the mathematical skills of struggling middle school students.
A sample of sixth-grade individuals was recruited to participate in a
25-week afterschool program. The participants included 253
sixth-graders from a large disadvantaged minority population andﬁve
teachers that were randomly chosen from a group of 25 instructors. The
students were randomly assigned to a teacher-centered and an ALEKS
centered classroom in an after-school setting. The authors applied a state
examination to measure students’ performance outcomes. Teachers were
also asked to rate students conduct, involvement, and need for assistance,
based on a three-point scale ranging from poor to excellent (not involved
to actively involved) and a 2-point scale reﬂecting no help to more help
than usual. At-test analysis was conducted on all scores, and no signiﬁ-
cant difference was observed between struggling students who partici-
pate in the ALEKS after-school tutoring program and those who did not.
However, students in the ALEKS-led condition required signiﬁcantly less
assistance in mathematics from teachers than their counterparts
(ALEKS-led: M ¼ 0.05, SD ¼ 0.11; and Teacher-led:M ¼ 0.65, SD ¼ 0.27).
In a similar study involving ALEKS at the secondary level,Huang et al.
(2016) conducted an experimental evaluation of 533 sixth-grade stu-
dents (from ﬁve middle schools) to explore the effects of ALEKS on
mathematics achievement. The research question for this study
addressed the mathematics performance gap in education and the pros-
pects of ITSs towards reducing this gap. The investigation focused on data
from the last 2-years of a 3-year study that placed students in an
after-school setting. The participants were randomly assigned to an
ALEKS ITS led and a teacher-led condition. The researchers conducted a
t-test analysis and observed no signiﬁcant difference in scores between
the two conditions (even though scores favored the ALEKS ITS condi-
tion). Nonetheless, the authors reported encouraging results for the
application of ALEKS to aid the education of struggling youth. The
practitioners concluded that White males and females, and African
American males and females performed differently on the math state test
in the teacher-led condition; and students who had varied individual
differences demonstrated similar performances in the ALEKS ITS setting.
Most of the above studies were implemented at the middle school
level of instruction. Few investigators have assessed the inﬂuences of the
ALEKS ITS on struggling students' mathematics performances at the high
school level of instruction, and that may identify program construct that
may act as predictors for students’ success. A possible explanation for
such limitations may be the constraints associated with the ability to
conduct large data analysis. However, recent developments in theﬁeld of
large data have opened up numerous possibilities of such investigations.
1.2.1. Data mining and learning analytics
Computer tutoring supports the diversi ﬁcation of instruction to
facilitate teaching and learning processes in and outside the classroom,
provides timely feedback to students andﬂexible learning plans, and
offers managerial assistance for synchronous and asynchronous educa-
tional processes (Chappell et al., 2015). Such personalization is bolstered
by the emergingﬁeld of large data analysis. Thisﬁeld facilitates the use
of EDM and LA to optimize understanding of student learning patterns
and behaviors in various CAI learning environments, and to support the
identiﬁcation of learning problems linked to the timely signs of students
at risk for academic failure and attrition (Gasevic et al., 2016). According
to Henrie et al. (2015), technology records summative and formative
data on students' system interactions and can provide pertinent data on
their engagement in learning. The behavior and progress data can be
recorded directly through these modalities (Hu et al., 2017). Gasevic
et al. (2016)posit that“the interpretation of these patterns can be used to
improve our understanding of learning and teaching processes, predict
the achievement of learning outcomes, and inform support interventions
and decisions on resources allocation” (p. 68). Most research in EDM and
LA has coalesced around predicting the achievement and retention of

The results from the logistic regression analysis of 44, 497 students favored the use of the technological products, and the ALEKS ITS was identiﬁed as one of the programs that demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant positive impact on struggling students' achievement. The survey data were obtained from 2, 933 teachers and a thematic approach was incorporated to identify commonalities. Teachers overall response to the use of the technology in the classroom was positive. Theﬁndings indicated that 57% of the teachers were satisﬁed with the software products and 10% were satisﬁed with their students' engagement when using these modalities. However, only 34% of the instructors reported using the performance management features within the products to monitor students’ progress. The authors reﬂected disappointment at the small percentage of responders who applied the management feature to support students and guide instruction as this was one of the primary function of the mathematical platforms.
In contrast to the aboveﬁndings, some researchers postulate that ALEKS provides minimal to no advantage to learning in traditional classrooms. Craig et al. (2013) reported insigniﬁcant ﬁnding in their experimental study that assessed the effectiveness of the ALEKS ITS on improving the mathematical skills of struggling middle school students. A sample of sixth-grade individuals was recruited to participate in a 25-week afterschool program. The participants included 253 sixth-graders from a large disadvantaged minority population andﬁve teachers that were randomly chosen from a group of 25 instructors. The students were randomly assigned to a teacher-centered and an ALEKS centered classroom in an after-school setting. The authors applied a state examination to measure students’ performance outcomes. Teachers were also asked to rate students conduct, involvement, and need for assistance, based on a three-point scale ranging from poor to excellent (not involved to actively involved) and a 2-point scale reﬂecting no help to more help than usual. At-test analysis was conducted on all scores, and no signiﬁcant difference was observed between struggling students who participate in the ALEKS after-school tutoring program and those who did not. However, students in the ALEKS-led condition required signiﬁcantly less assistance in mathematics from teachers than their counterparts (ALEKS-led: M ¼ 0.05, SD ¼ 0.11; and Teacher-led:M ¼ 0.65, SD ¼ 0.27).
In a similar study involving ALEKS at the secondary level,Huang et al. (2016) conducted an experimental evaluation of 533 sixth-grade students (from ﬁve middle schools) to explore the effects of ALEKS on mathematics achievement. The research question for this study addressed the mathematics performance gap in education and the prospects of ITSs towards reducing this gap. The investigation focused on data from the last 2-years of a 3-year study that placed students in an after-school setting. The participants were randomly assigned to an ALEKS ITS led and a teacher-led condition. The researchers conducted a t-test analysis and observed no signiﬁcant difference in scores between the two conditions (even though scores favored the ALEKS ITS condition). Nonetheless, the authors reported encouraging results for the application of ALEKS to aid the education of struggling youth. The practitioners concluded that White males and females, and African American males and females performed differently on the math state test in the teacher-led condition; and students who had varied individual differences demonstrated similar performances in the ALEKS ITS setting.
Most of the above studies were implemented at the middle school level of instruction. Few investigators have assessed the inﬂuences of the ALEKS ITS on struggling students' mathematics performances at the high school level of instruction, and that may identify program construct that may act as predictors for students’ success. A possible explanation for such limitations may be the constraints associated with the ability to conduct large data analysis. However, recent developments in theﬁeld of large data have opened up numerous possibilities of such investigations.
1.2.1. Data mining and learning analytics
Computer tutoring supports the diversi ﬁcation of instruction to facilitate teaching and learning processes in and outside the classroom, provides timely feedback to students andﬂexible learning plans, and offers managerial assistance for synchronous and asynchronous educational processes (Chappell et al., 2015). Such personalization is bolstered by the emergingﬁeld of large data analysis. Thisﬁeld facilitates the use of EDM and LA to optimize understanding of student learning patterns and behaviors in various CAI learning environments, and to support the identiﬁcation of learning problems linked to the timely signs of students at risk for academic failure and attrition (Gasevic et al., 2016). According to Henrie et al. (2015), technology records summative and formative data on students' system interactions and can provide pertinent data on their engagement in learning. The behavior and progress data can be recorded directly through these modalities (Hu et al., 2017). Gasevic et al. (2016)posit that“the interpretation of these patterns can be used to improve our understanding of learning and teaching processes, predict the achievement of learning outcomes, and inform support interventions and decisions on resources allocation” (p. 68). Most research in EDM and LA has coalesced around predicting the achievement and retention of"
2021 - ALEKS constructs as predictors of high school mathematics achievement for struggling students.pdf,"students at risk of failing particular CAI courses; and to identify common
variables that individually or collectively inform a general model
(Gasevic et al., 2016). Nonetheless, the literature on this body of research
is limited, and studies are commonly applied at the postsecondary level
to assess the impact of ITSs on students’ academic success. Some studies
have been employed at the secondary level; however, these studies
largely involve other ITS modalities (similar to ALEKS).
For example, a correlational study ofBringula et al. (2016)assessed the
relationship between high school students' prior mathematical knowledge
on time spent tutoring, total hints requested, and the number of completed
quizzes in a SimStudent ITS program. The participants were involved in
1-hour SimStudent sessions over a 3-day intervention period. These re-
spondents included 139 (of 236)ﬁrst-year high school students who were
enrolled in the Introductory Algebra course, and who completed both the
test examinations and the three-day intervention period. The authors
applied two measures for this investigation. The evaluation included three
Introductory Algebra pre- and post-test that were used to gain an under-
standing of students' knowledge (as related to linear equations), and data
logs related to students' interaction were collected from the SimStudent
(i.e., time spent tutoring, number of hints requested by the program, and
number of quizzes conducted) were correlated. Results indicated that 11 %
of the variability in the time spent tutoring, 5% of the variability in the
number of quizzes conducted, and 3% of the variability in the number of
hints requested were due to students’ prior mathematical knowledge. The
authors concluded that prior knowledge demonstrated a signiﬁcant,
consistent, positive inﬂuence on learner-interface interactions (i.e., time
spent tutoring, number of hints requested by the program, and number of
quizzes conducted) with the ITS program. Nonetheless, recommendations
were made to extend the intervention period for future studies.
Zacharis (2015)assessed data generated in the data logs of a computer
management system (Moodle) to determine a realistic model for predicting
struggling students' performance in blended-learning mathematics courses.
The author sought to determine the relationship between students'ﬁnal
course grades and their interaction in online modalities. The practitioner
accumulated 29 potential explanatory variables and identiﬁed 14 variables
with signiﬁcant association to students' course grades. These variables were
selected for application in a stepwise multivariate regression analysis. The
participants of the study included 134 college students who were enrolled
in an introductory Java programming course that was instituted over a
12-week period. The researchﬁndings indicated that reading and posting
message (37.6%), content creation contribution (10.4%), quiz effort
(2.5%), and the number ofﬁles viewed (1.5%) predicted 52% of the vari-
ance in studentﬁnal course grade. Reading and posting messages contrib-
uted the greatest variance (37.6%) in students’ scores.
Dani and Nasser (2016)conducted a study of ALEKS at the higher
education level to determine potential identiﬁers of students' academic
success in foundational mathematics. The participants included a sample
of 152 college students who were divided into three clusters (numbered
one – three) based on derived attributes. Students in cluster one
demonstrated the highest ratio of weekly topics mastered to topics
practiced (averaging 80%). Leaners in cluster three symbolized the
lowest values (averaging 53%) within this variable (cluster average
percentages represented 80%, 66%, and 53%). The research measures
involved students' activity data from the ALEKS data logs. The ALEKS
factors included learners' score on initial assessments, the ratio of weekly
topics mastered to topics practiced, number of progress test (knowledge
assessments), ﬁnal exam score, and whether students completed the
course before the 12-week period or not. A Chi-square, ANOVA test, and
Regression analysis were employed to address the research questions.
Results indicated that student ratio of topics mastered to practiced was
predictive of students' academic success in the course. This component
represented a signiﬁcant moderately strong, positive correlation with
student ﬁ
nal exam marks. The authors indicated that the ratio of topics
mastered to topics practices represented 16% of the variance in students'
ﬁnal exam scores. Further results indicated that learners’ English lan-
guage proﬁciency affected their ability to learn independently.
Dani (2016) implemented a quantitative investigation at the post-
secondary level to determine potential identiﬁers (within ALEKS) of stu-
dents' academic success. This study sought to expand onﬁndings from the
previous study carried out byDani and Nasser (2016). The respondents
included 58 students who were enrolled in a foundational mathematics
course over a 12-week period. The researchers implemented a
cross-sectional design to triangulate the measures of students’ALEKS data
logs and survey responses. The study implemented Chi-square, correla-
tional and regression analysis, and pairt-test to address the research
questions. Theﬁndings suggest that learners prior knowledge and derived
attitude (a ratio of topics mastered to topics practiced) were predictive of
ﬁnal course marks (R2 ¼42%). Further results indicated that students who
selected topics sequentially demonstrated better retention of mathemat-
ical content than students who progress randomly through topics. These
ﬁndings afford instructors the opportunity to monitor the progress of
struggling students who are unable to maintain proper pacing and provide
guidance in the selection of appropriate (sequential) topics.
The use of the ALEKS ITS in blended-learning settings affords edu-
cators the opportunity to customized instruction to address the individ-
ual needs of learners. Nonetheless, the body of research that explores
what factors of ITSs that are best predictors of struggling students' per-
formance is limited. Although studies exist at the postsecondary level
that addresses ALEKS factors (ratio of topics mastered to topics practiced)
to be predictive of students' mathematics success, very limited research
investigations have been conducted at the secondary level. Theﬁndings
from this study are expected to contribute to this knowledge base by
investigating factors of the ALEKS ITS online software that are predictive
of struggling students’ mathematics competency. Such insights can
facilitate greater success for learners who are at risk for failure in these
milieus, improve mathematical content knowledge, promote higher
graduation rates, and increased job opportunities.
Accordingly, the following broad research questions were addressed:
RQ1: Is engagement time, retention, and the ratio of topics mastered
to topics practiced (in ALEKS) for students identiﬁed as at risk for
failure in mathematics predictive ofﬁnal Algebra 1 course progress
grades?
RQ2: Is engagement time, retention, and the ratio of topics mastered
to topics practiced (in ALEKS) for students identiﬁed as at risk for
failure in mathematics predictive of PSAT math scores?
The following alternative hypotheses were tested:
H
a1: Engagement time, retention, and the ratio of topics mastered to
topics practiced (in ALEK) will be signiﬁcant predictors of ﬁnal
Algebra 1 course progress grades,α /C20 0.05.
Ha2: Engagement time, retention, and the ratio of topics mastered to
topics practiced (in ALEK) will be signiﬁcant predictors of PSAT math
scores, α /C20 0.05.
The null hypotheses were the following:
H
01: Engagement time, retention, and the ratio of topics mastered to
topics practiced (in ALEK) will not be signiﬁcant predictors ofﬁnal
Algebra 1 course progress grades,α /C20 0.05.
H02: Engagement time, retention, and the ratio of topics mastered to
topics practiced (in ALEK) will not be signiﬁcant predictors of PSAT
math scores,α /C20 0.05.

1.3. Theoretical foundations
The theoretical foundations for this investigation included the
knowledge space theory (KST), the ZPD, and the cognitive learning"
2021 - ALEKS constructs as predictors of high school mathematics achievement for struggling students.pdf,"theory (CLT) which are combined to assist the instruction and learning
process in blended-learning platforms.
1.3.1. Knowledge space theory
The knowledge space theory stems from the mathematical cognitive
sciences behind ALEKS (McGraw-Hill Education, 2017a). The origin of
this theoretical framework encompasses the work of Jean-Paul Doignon
and Jean-Claude Falmagne whose goal was to improve the psychometric
approach to assessing individual competencies (Doignon and Falmagne,
2015). These theorists described the KST as the collection of all possible
state of knowledge that exists within the mathematical domain (Craig
et al., 2013). A few researchers (Craig et al., 2013), stated that this theory
incorporates the compilation of various sets of problems as related to
mathematical concepts and problem-solving skills, and facts. Accord-
ingly, Doignon and Falmagne's ideas on the KST underscore the diagnosis
of students' math competencies (state of knowledge) based on their
mastery of particular items on adaptive knowledge assessments that are
comprised of 25–30 problem types (McGraw-Hills, 2017). Craig et al.
(2013) suggested that the program can identify what information stu-
dents already know and can apply; what they are ready to do; and what
they are unable to accomplish and adjust problem types based on the
analysis of all collected information.Thomas and Gilbert (2016)asserted
that this adaptive ability of ITSs is underpinned by the theoretical
foundations of the (ZPD) and the Cognitive Learning Theory (CLT).
1.3.2. Zone of Proximal Development
Vygotsky (1978) introduced the idea of the ZPD and identiﬁed stu-
dent’ intellectual development has not only what learners can do, but
also what they can do with assistance. By fostering the acquisition of the
learners' ZPD, educators can apply ITS scaffolding methods to support
learning processes to align new learning with what students already
know and can do, and concentrate lessons around what students are
prepared to learn with guidance. Through these practices, educators can
minimize learning anxiety by ensuring that appropriate tasks are pre-
sented with attention to students' background knowledge (Chounta et al.,
2017). Instructors can use the program to construct and identify new
knowledge based on the explorations and discoveries of what students
are ready to learn. Accordingly, educationalists can incorporate ITSs to
guide and consultant students’ academic learning.
1.3.3. Cognitive learning theory
Various theologians contributed to the cognitive principles. A few of
these theorists include Thorndike, Lindeman, Rogers, Maslow, and
Dewey's conceptualization of scientiﬁc thinking (Knowles et al., 2005).
The principle of cognitive theory places the learner's mental inquiry at
the center of learning, according toKnowles et al. (2005). These re-
searchers stated that learners' mental inquiries are inﬂuenced by intrinsic
and extrinsic experiences and the student's surrounding environment.
Knowles et al. (2005)aligned this theory with student-centered learning
environments, as opposed to conventional education where instruction is
teacher-centered and students are required to conform to the pedagogic
processes. The students garner educational acumen to achieve personal
objectives. Leaners demonstrate this understanding in the practices
associated with adult learning (andragogy) where learning is directly
inﬂuenced by the students and their experiences.Hawkins et al. (2017)
stated that through the acquisition of these background experiences,
learners are able to maximize their self-actualization and the ability to be
a self-directed learner. The latter promotes the personalization of new
information by stimulating a deep sense of value and meaning that fa-
cilitates personal growth (Hawkins et al., 2017). Learners apply this
awareness to cultivate a greater connectedness to new topics and to drive
motivation for furthering one's education. Hence, educators can incor-
porate personalized learning to promote reﬂection between learning and
experiences and facilitate active interaction to assess the trials and errors
of new knowledge. Program developers and educators apply these
insights to underscore the development and implementation of
one-to-one adaptive learning with the use of adaptive ITS programs.
Educationalists combine and apply the three philosophies in blended-
settings to optimize their abilities to differentiate instruction and effec-
tively address the needs of learners. Based on these theories, one would
predict that students who are provided with instruction at a level geared
to them would make considerable advances in mathematics achievement
and would demonstrate the acquisition of the current mathematical
standards as they relate to 21st-century skills.
1.4. Sample and setting
The sample for this study centered primarily on a purposive sample of
265 ninth- and 10th-grade high school students at an urban technical
high school in a low socioeconomic community in the northeast United
States. Creswell (2012) asserted that purposive sampling is frequently
applied in educational research because random selection and random
assignment to interventions are rarely possible in these settings.
Approximately 530,000 students from this state were enrolled in K-12
learning institutions at the time of this investigation, and an estimated
31,000 individuals represented the selected population that was germane
to this investigation. The guidance coordinator at the study location
stated that 585 of the individuals from this site were represented in
the selected population. The sampled 265 participants worked in the
ALEKS ITS program during the 2015–2016 and 2016–2017 academic
year, the ﬁrst 2 years of implementation. The author of this research
solicited individuals who participated in the ITS software, achieved a
ﬁnal progress grade for the course, and participated in the PSAT in the
Fall of their sophomore year. Individuals who were expelled, transferred
in or out of the program, or missing values relevant to this investigation
during this time frame were eliminated from the dataset. The data reports
of the participants reﬂected the ﬁrst and second year the intervention
was implemented in their ninth-grade Algebra 1 course (the 2015–2016
and 2016–2017 academic years). Students in other cohorts and from
other locations did not participate in this research. Including such par-
ticipants in the study may pose possible threats to external validity
(see Creswell, 2012).
The sample was very diverse in their experience, background
knowledge, and ability level and according to the guidance counselor, at
the site, a large percentage of learners were at least one to three grade
levels behind in their math learning. The researcher did not interact with
participants and instead applied student archival data reports as the
central analytical focus for this investigation. As a result, due to the na-
ture of this predictive study, there was no need to obtain participant
consent to conduct this investigation.
All ninth-grade students had been placed in (one of three) Algebra 1
blended-learning mastery-based math classes where one-to-one devices
had been implemented and the ALEKS ITS software program incorpo-
rated as the predominant form of instruction. The course groups were
organized and predetermined by the district and school leaders at the
study's location. The classrooms were assembled in a stationary format
where students worked in collaborative groups when learning in the
program before reporting to testing stations that were allotted for
knowledge assessments and district mathematics evaluations. Students
worked in the online program for the entire instructional period
(approximately 1 hour each school day) and also had the opportunity to
work in the program outside of school hours as well. In this environment,
teachers acted as facilitators to assist students as needed and to apply the
ALEKS managerial tools to monitor students who may need additional
support.
Upon logging into the ALEKS interface, students are offered an initial
assessment that evaluates the learner's state of knowledge. Once this
initial step is accomplished, each subsequent log-in directs students to
their pie chart that reﬂects their learning progress towards achieving
their course completion (refer toFigure 1for visual display). A student
can choose to work towards gaining new topics or to review topics

the selected population. The sampled 265 participants worked in the
ALEKS ITS program during the 2015–2016 and 2016–2017 academic
year, the ﬁrst 2 years of implementation. The author of this research
solicited individuals who participated in the ITS software, achieved a
ﬁnal progress grade for the course, and participated in the PSAT in the
Fall of their sophomore year. Individuals who were expelled, transferred
in or out of the program, or missing values relevant to this investigation
during this time frame were eliminated from the dataset. The data reports
of the participants reﬂected the ﬁrst and second year the intervention
was implemented in their ninth-grade Algebra 1 course (the 2015–2016
and 2016–2017 academic years). Students in other cohorts and from
other locations did not participate in this research. Including such par-
ticipants in the study may pose possible threats to external validity
(see Creswell, 2012).
The sample was very diverse in their experience, background
knowledge, and ability level and according to the guidance counselor, at
the site, a large percentage of learners were at least one to three grade
levels behind in their math learning. The researcher did not interact with
participants and instead applied student archival data reports as the
central analytical focus for this investigation. As a result, due to the na-
ture of this predictive study, there was no need to obtain participant
consent to conduct this investigation.
All ninth-grade students had been placed in (one of three) Algebra 1
blended-learning mastery-based math classes where one-to-one devices
had been implemented and the ALEKS ITS software program incorpo-
rated as the predominant form of instruction. The course groups were
organized and predetermined by the district and school leaders at the
study's location. The classrooms were assembled in a stationary format
where students worked in collaborative groups when learning in the
program before reporting to testing stations that were allotted for
knowledge assessments and district mathematics evaluations. Students
worked in the online program for the entire instructional period
(approximately 1 hour each school day) and also had the opportunity to
work in the program outside of school hours as well. In this environment,
teachers acted as facilitators to assist students as needed and to apply the
ALEKS managerial tools to monitor students who may need additional
support.
Upon logging into the ALEKS interface, students are offered an initial
assessment that evaluates the learner's state of knowledge. Once this
initial step is accomplished, each subsequent log-in directs students to
their pie chart that reﬂects their learning progress towards achieving
their course completion (refer toFigure 1for visual display). A student
can choose to work towards gaining new topics or to review topics"
2021 - ALEKS constructs as predictors of high school mathematics achievement for struggling students.pdf,"already learned (Dani and Nasser, 2016). Each slice of the ALEKS pie
chart depicts a different set of mathematics objectives that replicates the
learner's knowledge state depending on what he or she understands and
is ready to learn ( McGraw Hill Education, 2047b ). The program
sequentially delivers math topics; however, students can also choose to
work on any ready-to-learn topics within a given domain group (i.e., goal
topics; Dani and Nasser, 2016). Once presented with a topic, students can
request an explanation to support their learning or proceed to solve the
problem on their own. In addition to the latter, instructors required all
students to write notes to facilitate their learning needs.
Students are recognized in the program as having learned a topic after
three (toﬁve) consecutive correct responses to a problem type. According
to Dani (2016), these processes allow students to work at their own pace
and monitor their learning. Instructors assign students a knowledge
assessment once they have learned 10 or more topics. Nonetheless,
ALEKS also assigns a progress assessment base on topics mastered and
time spent in the software (Dani and Nasser, 2016). Accordingly, stu-
dents are provided with progress assessments after completion of
approximately 20–25 topics, and 10 hours of login time (McGraw Hill
Education, 2047b). Learners may gain or lose topics in their pie chart
based on their performances on provided progress assessments. These
working behaviors are logged and tracked in the ALEKS database and can
be applied to assess students’ learning within the online program (Dani
and Nasser, 2016).
The investigator assumed that mathematics teachers at this location
applied the ALEKS mastery-based curriculum effectively in the class-
rooms and students were actively engaged in the ITS during class time. In
addition, the author also assumed that selected participants were fully
versed in the use of the ALEKS ITS program in and outside of active
learning in the math course. However, threats to internal validity existed
as engagement time in the ALEKS ITS was recorded as the total time a
student is logged into the program irrespective of their active or inactive
performances. For example, a student can make no attempt to learn or
master topics while logged into the program and will accrue idle time
that is collected in the student's overall engagement time total (Dani,
2016). The accumulation and combination of these time differential in
ALEKS may have impeded the validity ofﬁndings germane to student
learning. Additionally, the students' ability to work in the program
outside of school hours might compromiseﬁndings as some students
might obtain assistance from their parents or older siblings during these
timeframes. The latter delineates some students attaining more assis-
tance than others. Such activities could have threatened the accuracy of
the ALEKS measures.
2. Method and material
A correlational predictive design was implemented to evaluated the
inﬂuence of the predictor variables (student engagement time, retention,
and the ratio of topics mastered to topics practiced) on struggling stu-
dents' performance as it pertains to the development of academic com-
petency in mathematics (the criterion variable). The archival data were
the focus of statistical analysis for this study. The author obtained the
data from the ALEKS ITS data logs and the guidance department at the
site of this investigation. The gathered reports reﬂected the mathematics
achievement and learning behavior of learners from one high school
institution. As previously stated, the participant groups were organized
and predetermined by the organization; and the ALEKS ITS intervention
was a district implemented intervention for the school beginning in the
Fall of 2015. Because the intervention was introduced and completed
before the collection of data, the researcher for this investigation was not
required to solicit informed consent from participants (National Institute
of Health,NIH; Ofﬁce of Extramural Research, n. d.). Nevertheless, the
author did obtain permission from the school district superintendent and
the school principal for accessing and collecting archived statistics for
this investigation; and once this study's IRB approval number
(03-26-18-0317860) was received, the author commenced with collect-
ing, organizing, and analyzing the data. Accordingly, the extracted data
were printed and compiled in Microsoft Excel for further analysis in the
SPSS software program.
The data were de-identi
ﬁed and linked to designated numbers that
excluded the names of participants. Three predictor (independent) var-
iables from the ALEKS data logs (retention, engagement time, and the
ratio of topics mastered to topic practiced) and two criterion (dependent)
variables (students'ﬁnal Algebra 1 progress grades and PSAT math per-
formance scores) were included in the analysis.Lodico et al. (2010)
asserted that a predictive correlational methodology affords the oppor-
tunity to predict the linear relationship between two or more variables
after the intervention period. By using this design, the author was able to
investigate the collective and individual association between the three
identiﬁed factors on mathematics competencies as deﬁned by the ALEKS
ITS online program theories and measured by the ALEKS data logs. A
multiple regression analysis was applied to test the hypotheses. The
correlation coefﬁcient (r) and z-scores (R2) were utilized to determine the
signiﬁcance of engagement time, retention, and the ratio of topics
mastered to topics practiced on students’ performance onﬁnal Algebra 1
course grades and/or PSAT scores. The following delineates the data
sources and descriptions of the scale for each variable.

2021 - ALEKS constructs as predictors of high school mathematics achievement for struggling students.pdf,"Engagement Time(depicted asET in data tables) is a predictor variable
that was extracted from the ALEKS database. This continuous variable
reﬂects the combined (active and inactive) time logged in the program
and is recorded in hours and minutes each time an individual logs in and
out of the ITS during instructional (during school) and non-instructional
(outside of school) periods. Accordingly, the author compiled the active
and inactive time for participants and used these time attributes to
explain student engagement within the context of this study. Hence, a
quantitative estimate of engagement time was arrived at by combining
students’ total log-in times in AKEKS from August 2015 to June 2016,
and August 2016 to June 2017. These averages were recorded as the total
amount of hours participants spent in the Algebra 1 class during the
designated time period for this study. These recorded hours ranged from
0 to 500.
Retention (depicted asren in the data tables) is a continuous predictor
variable that was acquired from the ALEKS database. Unlike theET
construct, retention cannot be obtained directly from the software pro-
gram. Nevertheless, the ALEKS program recognizes student's mastery of
learned topics after they have demonstrated their competency of learned
objectives on a knowledge assessment. The software records when stu-
dents initiate a knowledge assessment and tracks students' progress be-
tween each assessment. Students' mastery of topics canﬂuctuate in gains
and losses on progress between each knowledge assessment. The author
of this study collected these scores and calculated the average percent-
ages in mastered and learned topics. A comparison between participants
mastered and learned topics can be used to assess the average percentage
retention scores for individual learners and detect students who may
require additional supports. For example,Figure 2depicts a student that
mastered nine topics on their initial knowledge assessment, then learned
ten more during ALEKS instruction and achieved a total of 13 topics on
their subsequent knowledge test. The latter represents 40% of students'
retention in learning. Accordingly, this researcher collected these
retention percentage scores and an average estimate was established for
each student. Hence, this continuous variable ranges from 0 to 100, with
higher scores denoting students' increased retention in learning.
The Ratio of Topics Mastered to Topics Practiced(mtop) is a continuous
predictor variable that was obtained from two factors within the ALEKS
program (mastered and practiced topics). This continuous variable is an
attribute that was applied by Dani and Nasser (2016) to deﬁne the
learning patterns of students who worked in the ALEKS ITS platform.
Dani and Nasser (2016), andDani (2016), stated that this variable rep-
resents an abbreviation of mastered to practiced topics and denotes the
measure of students ability to learn independently. These authors stated
that a higher ratio of this variable indicates increased capabilities to learn
independently. Accordingly, this researcher applied this approach to
calculate this attribute for this investigation. The participants total
mastered and practiced topics were extracted for their respective years in
the ALEKS Algebra 1 course (from August 2015 to June 2016, and August
2016 to June 2017). The combined totals were recorded astotal topics
mastered (ttm)and total topics practiced (ttp)in the data tables. The quo-
tient of students'ttm to ttp were evaluated to establish a ratio of students’
mastered to practiced topics. This variable ranges from 0 to 1 in the data
tables with higher ratios reﬂecting increase rates of mastered to practiced
topics.

The PSAT, which was a continuous criterion variable in the study, is a
standardized aptitude test that is administered by the College Board to"
2021 - ALEKS constructs as predictors of high school mathematics achievement for struggling students.pdf,"assess the general intelligence of students in Grades 9 and 10 (Warne,
2016). It is also known as the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test
(NMSQT). The measure may also predict students' performance on the
SAT (Thum and Matta, 2015). According toRichardson et al. (2016), the
PSAT exam is a condensed form of the SAT that provides students with
feedback on current achievement skills. The exam tests learners' math-
ematics reasoning, critical reading, and writing skills (Richardson et al.,
2016; Warne, 2016), and is a strong indicator of students' performance on
the SAT (College Board, 2017a). The mathematics section of the PSAT
measures a student's conceptual understanding and reasoning skills in
numeracy (College Board, 2017a). This section includes topic objectives
that are relevant to Algebra 1 and Geometry courses. TheCollege Board
(2017b) asserts that a mathematic grade-level benchmark score of 480
(indicating students who are performing at or above grade level) is
established to track students' yearly progress towards attaining the SAT
benchmark.
The sectional scores for the PSAT/NMSQT have a correlation that is
greater than 0.80 with scores on the SAT and other measures of intelli-
gence (Warne, 2016), and are directly related to math scores on the SAT
College Board (2017c). For example, participants who completed the
PSAT and the SAT on the same day would reﬂect the same score on both
assessments. To ensure the validity and reliability of the SAT suite as-
sessments (including the PSATs) the College Board frequently reviews
student performance metrics and employs research-based designs to
consistently evaluate test forms, prompts, questions, and items types
(College Board, 2017d). A few researchers (Richardson et al., 2016)
applied a multiple regression analysis to assess the predictive ability of
portions of the PSAT on student advance placement performance and
discovered a strong predictability between portions of the PSAT and
students advance placement performance irrespective of ethnicity and
socioeconomic status. Another researcher (Warne, 2016) established a
conservative indicator of 0.84 as an internal reliability coefﬁcient for
each subtest of the PSAT. The author'sﬁndings also support the consis-
tency of PSAT scores across test variations under similar conditions.
Students' Final Progress Grades (SFPG)is a continuous criterion vari-
able that was ascertained from the school's guidance department. As
stated previously, educators can apply the ALEKS platform in learning
environments to monitor students' logged time and learning behavior
patterns, and provide progress assessments based on their working
behavior and time spent in the program (Dani and Nasser, 2016). Ac-
cording to researchers Falmagne et al., 2007, the program provides
valid and reliable data pertaining to students' academic performance in
mathematics. The mathematics teachers at the study site can apply this
information to monitor students' progress and differentiate instruction to
promote personalized learning, and to trackﬁnal course progress grades.
Math instructors at the location of this investigation, required learners to
write notes when working in the ALEKS ITS, complete a minimum of
7–10 topic and 7–10 hours per week, and to complete the ALEKS districts
goal assessments with a 70% minimum score. These teachers coalesced
the scores for these requirements into oneﬁnal percent average that
reﬂected the studentsﬁnal progress grades for the course. The latter was
used to denote the studentsﬁnal progress grades that ranged from 0 to
100 with higher scores reﬂecting increased progress with learning. Ac-
cording to the mathematics department chair at the site, students'ﬁnal
progress grades was calculated on a weighted average scale with 60%
representing ALEKS weekly topics, 15% depicting district assessment
scores, 15% indicating notebook checks, and 10% signifying ALEKS
weekly logged time in the program. The department chair stated that
math teachers at the site calculated the time and topic scores as a ratio of
weekly topics learned to 10 expected attained weekly topics, and weekly
hours gained to 10 expected attained weekly hours.
2.1. Preliminary testing
In this investigation, the author sought to predict the relationship
between and among continuous variables within a single group.Lodico
et al. (2010)asserted that a predictive correlational methodology affords
the opportunity to predict the linear relationship between two or more
variables after the intervention period. Hence, a multiple regression
analysis was applied to investigate the combined and individual strength
and the degree of association between the predictor variables on the
criterion variables.
Both descriptive and inferential statistics were in the evaluation.
Descriptive statistics describes the calculation of simple statistical mea-
sures such as mean, standard deviation, and correlational comparisons of
all represented predictor variables with criterion variables within the
study. Nonetheless, the validity of the study is contingent on the validity
of construct measures. Accordingly, a missing value assessment was
conducted to identify problematic data and these values were eliminated
from the sample set. Additionally, linear models and an ANOVA test were
utilized to aid in evaluating the linearity across the domains (Triola,
2012), and thePearson rcorrelation coefﬁcient was used to identify the
validity of each construct. The latter include an analysis of the magnitude
and direction that range from -1 to 1 to describe associations. Cohen's
heuristics was instituted to assist in evaluating the correlation coefﬁcient.
The Cohen's heuristics correlation provides absolute values of approxi-
mately decimal values .1, .3, and .5 to indicate small, medium and large
association between variables (Shaw et al., 2016). However, Zacharis
(2015) stated that these coefﬁcients are not effective at explaining why
there is a relationship or the interactions of these associations (i.e., how
two variables vary together). The researcher asserted that a multiple
regression analysis affords a better assessment of coefﬁcients while
controlling for other variables. As a result of these reviews, this analysis
was employed to address the research questions for this evaluation.
The multiple regression analysis was applied to investigate the pre-
dictive abilities of the ALEKS constructs (engagement time, retention,
and the ratio of topics mastered to topics practiced) on student
achievement measures (students'ﬁnal Algebra 1 course progress grades,
and PSAT math scores). The researcher sought to reject the previously
stated null-hypotheses and to ascertain an association between the var-
iables that is equal to zero (H1: p 6¼ 0, H2: p 6¼ 0, H0 (1): p ¼ 0, H0 (2): p ¼ 0,
α /C20 .05: where the predictor or independent variable or¼ engagement
time, retention, and the ratio of topics mastered to topics practiced; and
the criterion or dependent variable¼ students’ ﬁnal Algebra 1 course
progress grades, and PSAT math scores).
2.2. Test to research questions and null-hypotheses
According to Kirkpatrick and Feeney (2016), a multiple regression
uses a linear combination of predictors to determine the equation that
best predicts the criterion variable and the extent to which this equation
predicts the variability in the criterion variable. Hence, a linear model
comparison was incorporated to evaluate the collective and individual
predictability of the predictor variables on the criterion variables.Kirk-
patrick and Feeney (2016)asserted that the hierarchical model provides
the opportunity to test if two or more predictor variables collectively
predict increased variances in the criterion variable beyond what can be
predicted by one alone. The latter provides a better examination of the
effect size(R2) between predictor and criterion variable (Kirkpatrick and
Feeney, 2016). Consequently, inferential statistics including a multiple
regression analysis was employed to evaluate(R2) and to determine the
individual and combined proportion of the variance of the predictor
variables on the criterion variables.
An ANOVA test of signiﬁcance (F-test) was used to construct the least-
square prediction equation and assess the null-hypotheses that the
change inR2 is equal to zero in the population.Zacharis (2015)asserted
that this test reveals if theﬁnal regression model is signiﬁcant at the .05
level. The F-test determines if the sum of the squares (i.e., regression)
divided by the sum of squares (i.e., total) is equivalent toR2 (Kirkpatrick
and Feeney, 2016). All data were analyzed in the SPSS statistics 23
software with a .05 signiﬁcance level to determine the association and
strength between and among all constructs on students’ achievement.

Ac-cording to the mathematics department chair at the site, students'ﬁnal progress grades was calculated on a weighted average scale with 60% representing ALEKS weekly topics, 15% depicting district assessment scores, 15% indicating notebook checks, and 10% signifying ALEKS weekly logged time in the program. The department chair stated that math teachers at the site calculated the time and topic scores as a ratio of weekly topics learned to 10 expected attained weekly topics, and weekly hours gained to 10 expected attained weekly hours.
2.1. Preliminary testing
In this investigation, the author sought to predict the relationship between and among continuous variables within a single group.Lodico et al. asserted that a predictive correlational methodology affords the opportunity to predict the linear relationship between two or more variables after the intervention period. Hence, a multiple regression analysis was applied to investigate the combined and individual strength and the degree of association between the predictor variables on the criterion variables.
Both descriptive and inferential statistics were in the evaluation.
Descriptive statistics describes the calculation of simple statistical mea-sures such as mean, standard deviation, and correlational comparisons of all represented predictor variables with criterion variables within the study. Nonetheless, the validity of the study is contingent on the validity of construct measures. Accordingly, a missing value assessment was conducted to identify problematic data and these values were eliminated from the sample set. Additionally, linear models and an ANOVA test were utilized to aid in evaluating the linearity across the domains , and thePearson rcorrelation coefﬁcient was used to identify the validity of each construct. The latter include an analysis of the magnitude and direction that range from -1 to 1 to describe associations. Cohen's heuristics was instituted to assist in evaluating the correlation coefﬁcient.
The Cohen's heuristics correlation provides absolute values of approxi-mately decimal values .1, .3, and .5 to indicate small, medium and large association between variables. However, Zacharis stated that these coefﬁcients are not effective at explaining why there is a relationship or the interactions of these associations (i.e., how two variables vary together). The researcher asserted that a multiple regression analysis affords a better assessment of coefﬁcients while controlling for other variables. As a result of these reviews, this analysis was employed to address the research questions for this evaluation.
The multiple regression analysis was applied to investigate the pre-dictive abilities of the ALEKS constructs (engagement time, retention, and the ratio of topics mastered to topics practiced) on student achievement measures (students'ﬁnal Algebra 1 course progress grades, and PSAT math scores). The researcher sought to reject the previously stated null-hypotheses and to ascertain an association between the var-iables that is equal to zero (H1: p 6¼ 0, H2: p 6¼ 0, H0 (1): p ¼ 0, H0 (2): p ¼ 0,
α /C20 .05: where the predictor or independent variable or¼ engagement time, retention, and the ratio of topics mastered to topics practiced; and the criterion or dependent variable¼ students’ ﬁnal Algebra 1 course progress grades, and PSAT math scores).
2.2. Test to research questions and null-hypotheses
According to Kirkpatrick and Feeney , a multiple regression uses a linear combination of predictors to determine the equation that best predicts the criterion variable and the extent to which this equation predicts the variability in the criterion variable. Hence, a linear model comparison was incorporated to evaluate the collective and individual predictability of the predictor variables on the criterion variables.Kirk-patrick and Feeney asserted that the hierarchical model provides the opportunity to test if two or more predictor variables collectively predict increased variances in the criterion variable beyond what can be predicted by one alone. The latter provides a better examination of the effect size(R2) between predictor and criterion variable . Consequently, inferential statistics including a multiple regression analysis was employed to evaluate(R2) and to determine the individual and combined proportion of the variance of the predictor variables on the criterion variables.
An ANOVA test of signiﬁcance (F-test) was used to construct the least-square prediction equation and assess the null-hypotheses that the change inR2 is equal to zero in the population.Zacharis asserted that this test reveals if theﬁnal regression model is signiﬁcant at the .05 level. The F-test determines if the sum of the squares (i.e., regression) divided by the sum of squares (i.e., total) is equivalent toR2 . All data were analyzed in the SPSS statistics 23 software with a .05 signiﬁcance level to determine the association and strength between and among all constructs on students’ achievement."

3.1. Data analysis
In this evaluation, a descriptive analysis was conducted on all pre-
dictors (engagement time, retention, and the ratio of topics mastered to
topics practiced) and criterion variables (students'ﬁnal Algebra 1 course
progress grades and PSAT math scores for the 265 cases. The analysis
revealed that, of the predictors, the learners' engagement time had the
highest mean score of 155.87 with a standard deviation of 52.67 and
ranged from 49.17 to 470.95 total hours. These numbers demonstrate a
large spread within the data, which indicated that some students were
not spending enough time engaged in the ALEKS program. For example,
some students were not logging into the program enough, while others
were, perhaps, logging in but not actively working. The participants' ratio
of mastered to practiced topics had the second highest mean score of 0.69
with a standard deviation of 0.08 and ranged from 0.44 to 0.87 in ratio
scores. The students' retention mean score was 0.59 with a standard
deviation of 0.13 and ranged from 0.12 to 0.96 in average proportional
scores. Of the criterion variables, the PSAT math variable had a higher
mean score of 388.72 with standard deviation of 49.98 and a range span
from 240 to 530, and the students’ ﬁnal progress grade score had a mean
of 79.38 with standard deviation 12.82 and a range from 41 to 100.
These variables also had a large range and spread within the data. A
multiple regression analysis was implemented to determine the linearity
of the three predictor variables and their predictive abilities on the cri-
terion variables. No multicollinearity existed, allowing for a clear anal-
ysis of the predictive abilities of the independent variables on the
dependent variables (seeTriola, 2012). Table 1displays the descriptive
statistics of pertinent study variables using measures of central tendency
and variability, and Table 2 depicts the intercorrelations with these
variables.
3.2. Results for research question 1 and the corresponding null hypothesis
The data values for the criterion (dependent) variable of students'
ﬁnal progress grades in the Algebra 1 course were calculated from the
weighted averages of students' weekly learned topics ratios, active time
in the ALEKS program, notebook checks, and average district assessment
scores. The mean score for these averages was 79.38 with a standard
deviation of 12.82 and a range from 41 to 100. A bivariate correlation
was conducted to determine the relationship between the three pre-
dictors and theﬁnal progress grade scores. Students' engagement time
was the strongest and statistically signiﬁcant predictor of students'ﬁnal
progress grade scores followed by the mastered to practiced topics. A
moderately strong positive relationship existed between engagement
time and students'ﬁnal progress grades (r ¼ .43; p < .001), and the ratio
of mastered to practiced topics depicted a slightly medium positive as-
sociation withﬁnal progress grade scores (r ¼ .20; p < .001). No statis-
tically signiﬁcant correlation existed between students’ retention scores
and ﬁnal progress grades.Table 3represents the correlational relation-
ship between the three predictors on this criterion variable (SFPG).
After the initial descriptive and correlational analysis, a multiple
regression analysis was conducted using ﬁnal progress grades as the
dependent variable. The participants' engagement time, retention, and
mastered to practices topics were applied as independent variables. The
three predictors explained approximately 25.7% of the variance in stu-
dents' ﬁnal progress grade scores. TheR
2 for the full regression model
was .26 (F (3, 261)¼ 30.10; p < .001). The participants' engagement time
was the most signiﬁcant predictor of students'ﬁnal progress grades (t ¼
8.56; p < .001). Another signiﬁcant contributor to the model was the
students’ ratio of mastered to practiced topics (t ¼ 5.08; p < .001). In
light of theseﬁndings, the null hypothesis for research question 1 was
rejected and the corresponding alternative hypothesis was retained.
Table 4provides a summary of the full regression analysis for this model.
3.3. Results for research question 2 and the corresponding null hypothesis
The mean score for the criterion (dependent) variable PSATm was
388.72 with a standard deviation of 49.98 and a range from 240 to 530. A
bivariate correlation was conducted to determine the association be-
tween the three predictors and the PSAT math score. The participants'
retention and mastered to practiced topic scores presented a slightly
moderate and statistically signiﬁcant prediction of PSAT math scores,
with a slight predictive edge favoring students' retention (r ¼ .28; p <
.001) over the ratio of mastered to practiced topics (r ¼ .18; p < .001).
The analysis did not reveal a statistically signiﬁcant relationship between
the participants’ engagement time and the PSAT math score.Table 5
describes the correlational relationship between the three predictors on
this criterion variable (PSATm).
After descriptive and correlational analysis, a multiple regression
analysis was conducted using the PSAT math score as the dependent
variable. The students' engagement time, retention, and the ratio of
mastered to practiced topics were applied as independent variables. The
three predictors explained approximately 8.7% of the variance in PSAT
math scores. TheR
2 for the full regression model was .09 (F (3, 261)¼
8.27; p < .001). The participants’ retention was the only signiﬁcant
predictor of PSAT math scores (t ¼ 3.73; p < .001). In light of these
ﬁndings, the null hypothesis for research question 2 was rejected and the
corresponding alternative hypothesis was retained.Table 6illustrates the
summary of the full regression analysis for this model.

4. Discussion
The purpose of this study was to determine what factors of the ALEKS ITS are predictive of struggling learners' performance in a blended-learning Algebra 1 course at an inner-city technical high school located in the northeastern United States. Three variables (student retention, engagement time, and the ratio of topics mastered to topic practiced)"
2021 - ALEKS constructs as predictors of high school mathematics achievement for struggling students.pdf,"relating to the theoretical framework behind ALEKS were employed to
predict the degree of association on the criterion variable (mathematics
competencies) as measured byﬁnal course progress grades in Algebra
and the PSAT math scores. Findings suggest that the most statistically
signiﬁcant predictor of students’ ﬁnal progress grades was engagement
time followed by the mastered to practiced topics. Nevertheless, these
factors were not signiﬁcant contributors in predicting the PSAT math
score, and retention was identiﬁed as the lone statistically signiﬁcant
predictor of this criterion variable.
The ﬁndings of this study indicate that instructional practices in
ALEKS that include increased engagement time and mastery of topics,
and that maximize retention in learning, may improve the authentic
mathematics learning experiences of struggling students at this location.
Based on theseﬁndings, one could deduce that increase learning patterns
in these constructs in ALEKS are predictive of struggling students'
achievement in high school mathematics. The three predictors from this
study accounted for approximately 26% of the variance in students'ﬁnal
progress grades which is corroborated with previous research (Bringula
et al., 2016; Dani, 2016; Dani and Nasser, 2016). These researchers
observed that students' ratio of mastered to practiced topics in ALEKS
were signiﬁcantly predictive of academic success in math courses (Dani,
2016; Dani and Nasser, 2016). They also found that time spent tutoring is
signiﬁcantly correlated with learners' interactions in such modalities
(Dani, 2016; Dani and Nasser, 2016). Dani (2016) and Bringula et al.
(2016) linked these attributes to learners' prior knowledge and derived
attitude. Such information suggests that these students’ prior knowledge
and conﬁdence or self-efﬁcacy are essential factors for success in the
ALEKS program.
Dani (2016) identiﬁed a statistically signiﬁcant moderately strong
and positive correlation between the values of mastered to practiced
topics and students'ﬁnal exam marks. The latter indicates that students
with higher yields in this variable are able to master most of the topics
they are attempting to learn. This capacity was connected to students'
prior knowledge, Dani concluded. Similarly, Bringula et al. (2016)
discovered that 11% of the variance in students' time spent in tutoring
was due to students' prior knowledge. Dani found that learners' prior
knowledge along with their levels of mastered to practiced topics
facilitated a higher correlation withﬁnal exam scores. Theseﬁndings
indicate that students' percentages of mastered to practiced topics (in
ALEKS), along with their time spent in tutoring, are essential predictor of
ﬁnal course grades. This information suggests that instructional practices
that maximize students' engagement time in order to increase their
values in mastered to practiced topics may support improved progress
when learning in the ALEKS platform. For example, instructors may
provide timed and topic bound instruction on a daily basis to increase the
percentages in students’ mastered topics and may facilitate improved
learning in the ALEKS program. Such practices may support the learning
of struggling students within this modality, in addition to providing
opportunities to build their motivation and conﬁdence when working in
the program.
The ALEKS program gathers data pertinent to students mathe-
matical learning patterns and applies this information to personalize
learning experiences. Based on the theoretical framework underpin-
ning it, the program can generate personalized sequences of problems
that are geared towards the learners' ZPD ( Thomas and Gilbert,
2016) and provide guidance via instructional practice and assessment
reviews (Craig et al., 2013). Accordingly, the ALEKS ITS may support
conﬁdence building for students to problem solve and improve
mastery of mathematical concepts. Nonetheless, the lack of contin-
uous step-by-step feedback, instruction relevant to the application of
student review capabilities, and a viable process to identify students'
retention may limit the program's capacity to maximize the
achievement, andragogic processes, and con ﬁdence building in
struggling learners at the research site (see Dani, 2016; Dani and
Nasser, 2016).
According to the department chair at the site, struggling students (at
the research location) demonstrated apprehension to making errors or
losing topics when working in the ALEKS ITS and when these instances
occurred, students became despondent and lost conﬁdence in their math
skills and their ability to succeed. A reﬂection on the letter led this
researcher to conclude that such processes may be avoided if ALEKS
developers incorporate more scaffolding, additional feedback related to
retention as a separate construct, and better alignment review options to
support students who are at risk for failure in math courses at this site.
These additional supports may improve the ability of students to apply
strategies for problem-solving and improve the capability of the program
to measure metacognitive skills.
Dani and Nasser (2016)also discussed the topic of building students'
conﬁdence in the ALEKS program. These authors expressed the need to
provide learners with additional training on how to use the system
effectively. The researchers noted that such practices may remove tech-
nical barriers and improve students' ability to learn independently while
promoting the andragogic skills needed to bolster students’ success in the
platform.

2021 - ALEKS constructs as predictors of high school mathematics achievement for struggling students.pdf,"The ALEKS instructional program creates more student-centered
learning opportunities to apply metacognitive skills to develop motiva-
tion and active learning (Cigdem, 2015). According toButzler (2016)and
Duffy and Azevedo (2015), many at-risk students lack the self-regulation
learning skills that are essential for success in such platforms.Cigdem
(2015) and Greene et al. (2015) identiﬁed learners' perceived
self-efﬁcacy as one of the factors that inﬂuences motivation for learning
and performance. Hence, motivation is viewed as an essential variable for
the demonstration of self-regulation strategies and learning in online
learning settings (Duffy and Azevedo, 2015). This study'sﬁndings may
assist struggling students in better understanding and applying strategies
to address their personal needs to promote self-regulation skills. These
students may also be able to build their motivation for learning in this
arena.
The ﬁndings from this investigation may also further teaching and
learning in the ALEKS platform. Program developers and educationalists
can apply gained insights to improve the application of this modality
with effective instructional practices to better identify students who are
at risk for failure and provide learning interventions to address their
individual needs. Such actions may bolster the performances of strug-
gling learners within these programs.
4.1. Limitations of the study
Various ITSs are applied in learning institutions across the United
States to enhance students' achievements. These ITSs provide speciﬁc
types of adaptive instruction to remediate and improve the cognitive
achievements of learners (Bartelet et al., 2016). Erumit and Nabiyev
(2015) noted that ITS programs aim to identify, guide, and improve
students' understanding towards acquiring desired behavior. In the cur-
rent evaluation, a correlational design was applied to assess the predic-
tive impact of three predictor variables (retention, engagement time, and
the ratio of mastered to practiced topics) to students’ math achievement
(the criterion variable) as measured by PSAT math performance andﬁnal
progress course grades. As previously stated, the study was centered
primarily on 265 students in the 9th and 10th grades at an urban tech-
nical high school in the northeastern United States. Students in other
cohorts and from other locations did not participate in this research.
Nevertheless, the particularities of the sample group for this investigation
may have compromised the external validity of the study. Creswell
(2012) stated that purposive sampling techniques promote possible se-
lection bias in research studies.
Several threats to internal validity existed in the study as engagement
time in the ALEKS ITS was recorded as the total time a student is logged
into the program irrespective of their active or inactive performances.
The accumulation and combination of these time differential in ALEKS
may have impeded the validity ofﬁndings germane to student learning.
In addition to the latter, the students' ability to work in the program
outside of school hours might have compromised theﬁndings as some
students might obtain assistance from their parents or older siblings
during these time frames. The learners’ ability to participate in such
activities may have threatened the accuracy of the ALEKS engagement
time construct. Consequently, due to the unique nature of the sample and
choice of methodology, as well as the identiﬁed predictor variables for
this study, results may not be generalized to other ITS programs other
than ALEKS or beyond the speciﬁc population from which the sample
was drawn.
4.2. Recommendations
The results from the investigation coincides withﬁndings by
Sullins
et al. (2013)which suggest that learners' proﬁciency in ALEKS can be a
potential predictor of their performance on state assessments. These
practitioners applied students' mastery of topics in ALEKS as the catalyst
for success. Nevertheless, the researchers' use of this construct as the
primary driving force of their research contradicts the outcomes of the
current study which identify retention as the main variable to inﬂuence
the state assessment measures. The contradiction in constructs between
the two studies may pertain to additional factors that inﬂuence student
performance at the state level. Theﬁndings from this investigation sug-
gest that participants‘retention accounted for approximately 9% of the
variance on the PSAT math score. Based on this result, it was concluded
that an estimated 91% of the variance was due to other factors. These
additional constructs may include misalignment between students’ level
of performance and ITS tools and curriculum, in addition to grade-level
standards and instructional strategies to promote engagement and
motivation (Hawkins et al., 2017). The latter support calls for additional
investigation on this topic at this level of instruction.
A few researchers (Bringula et al., 2016; Dani, 2016), identiﬁed
learners' prior knowledge and derived attitude to improved achievement
in the ALEKS program. These authors used an initial assessment as a
predictive construct on students' mathematics success. Dani (2016)
asserted that learners' poor language skills is a factor that affects students'
ability to learn independently in the ALEKS platform. The current
investigation did not apply these constructs as the predictive variables for
the analysis. Consequently, additional research that incorporates these
elements, as well as other variables that may inﬂuence students’ learning
and retention in this platform is needed.
The current study centered on the predictive ability of three ALEKS
factors (engagement time, retention, and the ratio of mastered to prac-
ticed topics) on the math achievement of struggling learners at the high
school level. The body of research related to thisﬁeld of study is limited,
and results have been inconsistent (Chappell et al., 2015). As a result, I
recommend that future research address other factors of ALEKS and
include diverse groups and sizes, as well as the various instructional
practices that may impact the application of ALEKS at this instructional
level. Such insights may optimize consistency within the body of research
that addresses this topic.
4.3. Implications
The ﬁndings from this study suggest that participants' engagement
time and the ratio of mastered to practiced topics in ALEKS were
signiﬁcant predictors of struggling students'ﬁnal progress grades in a
high school Algebra 1 course, and retention was signiﬁcantly predic-
tive of PSAT math scores. Based on these results, one could infer that
increase learning patterns in these constructs in ALEKS are predictive
of struggling students' high school mathematical achievement. Sug-
gesting that improvements in the implementation of the ALEKS pro-
gram at the research site may optimize the mathematical achievement
of struggling learners. Accordingly, mathematics practitioners at this
site should apply instructional practices to increase the engagement
time and the number of mastered to practiced topics in ALEKS to
support improvements in students' ﬁnal progress course grades, and
expand the use of ALEKS retention reviews to optimize learners'
retention in mathematics and improve their performance at the state
and national level. Educationalist at the site of this investigation may
apply such information to increase the quality and effectiveness of
combining the ALEKS ITS with best teaching practices to foster
improved educational outcomes for struggling learners. The latter may
include modiﬁcations in the application of the ALEKS program relative
to students
’ prior knowledge.
Technology developers can incorporate suchﬁndings to improve the
working efﬁciency of the ALEKS ITS software program. For example, the
developers may incorporate ways to decipher learners' active and inac-
tive time in this platform and provide addition practices to improve
students’ retention. The mathematics instructors at this research location
can use this information to more effectively identify and address the
speciﬁc learning needs of their students. These actions may result in
struggling learners (at this location) mastering and retaining more math
concepts at a quicker pace. Thus, increasing the likelihood of greater
success in this milieu, greater math proﬁciency, reduction in failure rates,

11","The ALEKS instructional program creates more student-centered
learning opportunities to apply metacognitive skills to develop motiva-
tion and active learning. According toButzler and
Duffy and Azevedo, many at-risk students lack the self-regulation
learning skills that are essential for success in such platforms.Cigdem
and Greene et al. identiﬁed learners' perceived
self-efﬁcacy as one of the factors that inﬂuences motivation for learning
and performance. Hence, motivation is viewed as an essential variable for
the demonstration of self-regulation strategies and learning in online
learning settings. This study'sﬁndings may
assist struggling students in better understanding and applying strategies
to address their personal needs to promote self-regulation skills. These
students may also be able to build their motivation for learning in this
arena.
The ﬁndings from this investigation may also further teaching and
learning in the ALEKS platform. Program developers and educationalists
can apply gained insights to improve the application of this modality
with effective instructional practices to better identify students who are
at risk for failure and provide learning interventions to address their
individual needs. Such actions may bolster the performances of strug-
gling learners within these programs.
4.1. Limitations of the study
Various ITSs are applied in learning institutions across the United
States to enhance students' achievements. These ITSs provide speciﬁc
types of adaptive instruction to remediate and improve the cognitive
achievements of learners. Erumit and Nabiyev
noted that ITS programs aim to identify, guide, and improve
students' understanding towards acquiring desired behavior. In the cur-
rent evaluation, a correlational design was applied to assess the predic-
tive impact of three predictor variables (retention, engagement time, and
the ratio of mastered to practiced topics) to students’ math achievement
(the criterion variable) as measured by PSAT math performance andﬁnal
progress course grades. As previously stated, the study was centered
primarily on 265 students in the 9th and 10th grades at an urban tech-
nical high school in the northeastern United States. Students in other
cohorts and from other locations did not participate in this research.
Nevertheless, the particularities of the sample group for this investigation
may have compromised the external validity of the study. Creswell
stated that purposive sampling techniques promote possible se-
lection bias in research studies.
Several threats to internal validity existed in the study as engagement
time in the ALEKS ITS was recorded as the total time a student is logged
into the program irrespective of their active or inactive performances.
The accumulation and combination of these time differential in ALEKS
may have impeded the validity ofﬁndings germane to student learning.
In addition to the latter, the students' ability to work in the program
outside of school hours might have compromised theﬁndings as some
students might obtain assistance from their parents or older siblings
during these time frames. The learners’ ability to participate in such
activities may have threatened the accuracy of the ALEKS engagement
time construct. Consequently, due to the unique nature of the sample and
choice of methodology, as well as the identiﬁed predictor variables for
this study, results may not be generalized to other ITS programs other
than ALEKS or beyond the speciﬁc population from which the sample
was drawn.

5. Conclusion
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictability of three
ALEKS constructs on high school students mathematics success. A mul-
tiple regression analysis was utilized to assess the ALEKS data logs of 265
struggling high school students. The predictor variables included stu-
dents’ engagement time, retention, and the ratio of mastered to practiced
topics and the criterion variable comprised of PSAT math score and
students ﬁnal course progress grade. Results indicate that engagement
time followed by mastered to practiced topics were the most statistically
signiﬁcant predictors ofﬁnal progress grade, and retention was identiﬁed
as the sole statistically signiﬁcant predictor of PSAT math score. ALEKS
developers can apply this information to manifest changes within this

to maximize instruction and learning in the ALEKS ITS to support the
mathematical proﬁciency of struggling learners. Such actions may bolster
the self-efﬁcacy and self-regulation skill of these struggling youth and
support their future growth beyond secondary education.
