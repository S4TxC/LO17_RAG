Correlates of students’ internalization and
deﬁance of classroom rules: A self-determination

Background. It is generally accepted that well-established classroom rules prevent
problem behaviour, while also supporting students’ achievement gains. Yet, there might
be considerable variability in students’ underlying motives to comply or refrain from
complying with classroom rules, with some students adhering to them because they fully
accept them as their own, and others feeling compelled by external or internal demands to
do so or even defying the rules altogether.
Aims. Grounded in self-determination theory, this study aimed to examine whether
students’ reasons for following (i.e., internalization) and for refraining from following (i.e.,
deﬁance) classroom rules differentially and uniquely predict student outcomes, including
feelings of resentment, acting out, cheating, and truancy.
Sample. A total of 1006 students (46.7% boys; M = 14.18 years /C61.73) out of 56
different secondary school classes participated in the study.
Methods. Students were invited to ﬁll out an online survey about experiences with their
head teacher.
Results. For three out of four outcomes, identiﬁed regulation and external regulation to
follow classroom rules were found to be, respectively, negatively and positively related,
whereas a null relationship with introjected rule following was found. Controlled non-rule
following was most strongly predictive of maladaptive functioning, as indexed by more
feelings of resentment, acting out, cheating, and truancy.
Conclusions. Whereas students’ ownership of rules is critical to prevent classroom
misbehaviour, their pressured non-adherence is a risk factor.
For many teachers, the adequate handling of students’ misbehaviours such as disruptive
talking, harassing classmates, skipping classes, and cheating is one of the most pressing
concerns they are facing daily in the classroom (Browers & Tomic, 2000). Large-scale
surveys with nationally representative samples have shown that the prevalence of student
misbehaviour is fairly high. With 54% of 8 –12 grade students in the United States
exhibiting at least one out of a list of seven speciﬁc misbehaviours (e.g., skipping classes,
disruptive behaviour, ﬁghting; Finn, Fish, & Scott, 2008), over 90% of American 9 –12
grade students reporting having cheated at least once during their high school career

secondary school students, student misbehaviour clearly is a challenge for teachers that
traverses national boundaries. Moreover, researchers have reported that speciﬁc
disruptive classroom behaviours are directly connected to poorer academic achievement
and dropout (Finn et al., 2008).
Within the literature, it is generally accepted that well-established classroom rules
prevent problem behaviour (Grossman, 2004; Kerr & Nelson, 2006), while also
supporting students’ achievement (Brophy, 1999; Korpershoek, Harms, de Boer, van
Kuijk, & Doolaard, 2016; Schwab & Elias, 2015). Classroom rules are deﬁned as explicit
expectations regarding cooperative and desirable (e.g., raising hands to answer a
question) and disruptive and undesirable (e.g., disturbing others while they are working,
cheating when taking a test) classroom behaviours (Evertson & Emmer, 1982; Evertson &
Weinstein, 2006). Although clear classroom rules intend to encourage students to take
responsibility for their behaviour (Gable, Hester, Rock, & Hughes, 2009), there is
considerable variability in students’ motives to comply with these rules (Way, 2011), with
some students adhering to them because they fully endorse or internalize the rules as their
own and other students feeling compelled by external or internal demands to do so.
Furthermore, at least some students defy instead of internalize classroom rules as when
they oppose pressuring expectations or feel pressured to stick to internally held standards
for non-compliance (Aelterman, Vansteenkiste, Soenens, & Haerens, 2016). Insights into
why students both obey and disregard classroom rules may help us understand why
students misbehave in school. Grounded in self-determination theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan,
2000; Ryan & Deci, 2017), the aim of this study was to examine whether students’
underlying reasons for following (i.e., internalization) and refraining from following (i.e.,
deﬁance) classroom rules differentially and uniquely predict indicators of misbehaviour in
the classroom.
Towards ownership of rules: The process of internalization
According to SDT, students’ adherence to established classroom rules depends on the
extent to which they fully accept, internalize, and personally endorse these rules (Deci &
Ryan, 2000; Grusec & Goodnow, 1994). When the reason for complying with a rule has
not been internalized at all, the behavioural regulation is said to be external, as students
comply with classroom rules out of fear for punishment, to avoid the removal of privileges,
or to gain rewards and appreciation (i.e., external regulation). When pressures from
within are at play, such as when students comply with the rules to feel worthy and be seen
as a loyal and conscientious model student or to avoid feelings of guilt, shame, and self-
criticism (Assor, Vansteenkiste, & Kaplan, 2009), the regulation is labelled introjection.
Introjected regulation constitutes partial internalization, as the reason for adhering to
rules is no longer outside the student; yet, the student has not fully accepted the value of
the rule as his own.
A fuller form of internalized regulation occurs when students understand and accept
the value of a rule or standard. In the case of identiﬁed regulation, classroom rules are
perceived to be endowed with personal signiﬁcance and purpose as they help attaining
personally valued immediate or long-term outcomes (Vansteenkiste et al., 2018). Because
students have internalized the reason for complying with classroom rules, they more
volitionally stick to these rules and thus take more personal responsibility for their
functioning. Finally, to the extent that students’ reasons for complying with a rule are

students are said to function in an integrated manner, which represents the fullest, most
complete form of internalization. Such integrated regulation may, however, not be easily
achieved on a day-to-day basis (Sheldon & Kasser, 2001) and may require considerable
introspection, self-awareness, and maturity (Brickell & Chatzisarantis, 2007).

Up until today, SDT-based educational research has primarily focused on these
motivational regulations in relation to studying (Ryan & Connell, 1989). Dozens of studies
have shown that greater internalization of studying is predictive of a myriad of positive
outcomes, including more persistence, more behavioural engagement, greater use of
adaptive learning strategies, more deep-level learning, less test anxiety and emotional
disaffection, less procrastination, and better grades (see Guay, Ratelle, & Chanal, 2008;
Ryan & Deci, 2017; Skinner, 2016; Vansteenkiste et al., 2018 for an overview). In addition,
research indicates that students who have a deep interest in the material and who seek
personal development (i.e., internalization) report less cheating (Murdoch & Anderman,
2006; Vansteenkiste, Sierens, Soenens, Luyckx, & Lens, 2009) and are less likely to drop
out (Vallerand, Fortier, & Guay, 1997) than those who view the work as a means to an end
or seek to outperform their classmates.
Although student compliance with classroom rules relates negatively to disruptive
behaviour (Ducharme & Shecter, 2011), few, if any, SDT-based studies have examined the
role of students’ internalization of classroom rules in the prediction of student
misbehaviour. In one study addressing this issue, Wentzel, Filisetti, and Looney (2007)
examined junior high school students’ reasons for behaving in a prosocial manner, as
indexed by reasons for cooperating with a classmate, helping and following classroom
rules, and their links with peer- and teacher-rated prosocial behaviour. Results revealed
that identiﬁed and introjected regulation for acting prosocially correlated positively,
whereas external regulation was unrelated to prosocial behaviour. In a similar vein, Roth,
Kanat-Maymon, and Bibi (2011) showed that identiﬁed regulation for acting prosocially
correlated negatively, whereas externally regulated prosociality correlated positively with
self-reported bullying in school. These studies mainly focused on correlates of students’
internalization of commandments that apply in the classroom (e.g., ‘help a classmate in
distress’). However, classroom rules often also take the form of prohibitions, which are
intended to prevent the occurrence of undesirable behaviours and disciplinary problems
(e.g., ‘do not cheat when taking a test’). A few studies, especially in the parenting domain
(Soenens, Vansteenkiste, & Niemiec, 2009; Vansteenkiste, Soenens, Van Petegem, &
Duriez, 2014), have already looked into youngsters’ internalization of prohibitions. For
example, Soenens et al. (2009) found that a lack of internalization of parental rules for
friendships among adolescents related positively to deviant peer afﬁliation, which in turn
related positively to involvement in problem behaviours.
Deﬁance of classroom rules
For a class to function harmoniously and to enhance opportunities for learning, students
ideally internalize the established classroom rules (Schwab & Elias, 2015). Yet, some
1Intrinsic motivation represents the prototype of autonomously regulated behaviour. When intrinsically motivated, students
perform an activity out of a sense of enjoyment and interest in the activity itself. In the case of rule following, intrinsic motivation
(e.g., ‘following rules is really fun’) might apply only to a minority of individuals, so that, identiﬁed (and integrated) regulation, which
are considered the end points of the internalisation process, are more relevant regulatory subtypes in this context (Ryan & Deci,
2017; Vansteenkiste, Niemiec, & Soenens, 2010).

Deﬁance of classroom rules
For a class to function harmoniously and to enhance opportunities for learning, students
ideally internalize the established classroom rules (Schwab & Elias, 2015). Yet, some"
2018 - Correlates of students’ internalization and defiance of classroom rules A self‐determination theory.pdf,"students may be unwilling to follow rules and instead may be deﬁant against these rules
(Vansteenkiste et al., 2014; Way, 2011). The concept of deﬁance has, however, received
little explicit attention within SDT (but see Aelterman et al., 2016). Indeed, a lacuna in the
extant literature is that SDT, much like other contemporary motivational theories, focuses
mainly on the ‘why’ of human behaviour, at the expense of the ‘why not’ of behaviour
(Vansteenkiste & Mouratidis, 2016; but see Legault, Green-Demers, & Pelletier, 2006;
Vansteenkiste, Lens, Dewitte, De Witte, & Deci, 2004).
Within SDT, underlying reasons for not performing a target activity have almost been
exclusively studied through the notion of amotivation, which exists when people lack
intentionality or energy to act and are discouraged to engage in the activity (Ryan, Lynch,
Vansteenkiste, & Deci, 2011). Yet, a lack of motivation may also take the form of
oppositional deﬁance, as when students feel either externally or internally pressured to
refrain from rule compliance (Aelterman et al., 2016). Indeed, when students are exposed
to pressuring circumstances, they may also react with more active forms of non-
compliance (Van Petegem, Soenens, Vansteenkiste, Beyers, & Aelterman, 2015).
Speciﬁcally, the presence of an overly demanding teacher or the pressure to save face
in front of peers constitute examples of external pressure that may put students at risk for
a power game with their teacher to maintain or establish their independence. To oppose
these external forces, students may engage in disruptive behaviour that is against odds
with following the established rules. But students can also feel internally pressured to defy
the teacher’s requests and expectations such as when they hold particular internal
standards or stereotypes, they have to stick to as to protect their ego. For instance, when
they consider following rules to be ‘for teachers’ pets’, they feel pressured by an inner
voice to not comply with these rules as to prove to themselves they do not belong to such a
category of students. Regardless of whether students’ deﬁance of rules is grounded in
more external or internal demands, it reﬂects the tendency to seek distance from the
teacher (Van Petegem et al., 2015). Because deﬁance is not based upon self-endorsed
values and choices but instead is determined by external or internal pressures they
oppose, it can be conceived as a form of anti-internalization. This type of deﬁance has been
labelled as controlled motivated non-participation (Aelterman et al., 2016). In their study,
Aelterman et al.(2016) provided conﬁrmatory factorial evidence that controlled reasons
for not putting effort into the lesson can be clearly distinguished from students’ motives
for participation. In addition, controlled motivated non-participation was positively
associated with controlled motivation to participate, indicating that it constitutes
pressured functioning. Further, controlled motivated non-participation yielded unique
positive associations with feelings of resentment towards both the learning material and
the teacher, which emerged above and beyond the other motivational dimensions (i.e.,
autonomous participation, controlled participation, amotivation). Yet, controlled moti-
vated non-participation failed to uniquely predict self-reported learning and teacher-rated
performance (Aelterman et al., 2016).
The present study
The overall goal of this study was to examine the unique predictive validity of students’
reasons for following (i.e., identiﬁed, introjected, and external rule following) and
refraining from following (i.e., controlled non-rule following) classroom rules in relation
to feelings of resentment, acting out, cheating, and truancy. In line with previous studies,
we expected identiﬁed rule following to yield the strongest negative associations (Roth

Method
Participants and procedure
This study involved a convenience sample of students from one large public urban
secondary school in Flanders (Belgium) that voluntarily participated in the data collection
as part of a reform trajectory on fostering the motivational climate in the school. All
students within the school were invited to ﬁll out an online survey about experiences with
their head teacher. In a class with alternating teachers for different subjects – as is the case
in secondary schools in Belgium – the head teacher is the primary contact point and
conﬁdential person for students (and their parents) of a speciﬁc class. The head teacher
has the task of monitoring the academic progress and well-being of the students, and
fostering the social relationships and team spirit within the class throughout the school
year. At the moment of data collection, students were approximately 2 months into the
school year.
The sample consisted of 1,006 students (46.7% boys) out of 56 different secondary
school classes taught by a different teacher. The mean age of the students was 14.18 years
(SD = 1.73; range 11 –19 years). Of the sample, 85% had a Belgian nationality, whereas
15% of the students reported to have another, non-speciﬁed nationality. Information
about the socioeconomic status of the students was not available. In terms of education
type, 941 students were enrolled in an academic track (93.5%), whereas 65 students
(6.5%) followed a technical track. On average, students were taught 4.14 hr per week
(range 1 –15 hr) by their head teacher. Participation in the study was voluntary and
conﬁdential, and students could drop out at any time for any reason. A passive parental
consent method was used by distributing a letter to students’ parents explaining the
purposes of the study and providing a method to retract permission. None of the parents
objected to their child participating in the study. In total, 94 students (response rate:
1006/1100 = 91%) did not participate in the survey due to illness or absence for non-
speciﬁed reasons. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Ghent
University.
Measures
Unless mentioned otherwise, students responded to the items on a 5-point Likert scale
ranging from 1 (not at all true for me) to 5 (very true for me). Total scores for each scale
were calculated by averaging across the items.
Internalization of classroom rules
Students’ reasons for following classroom rules were assessed with the Self-Regulation
Questionnaire-Parental Rules (Soenens et al., 2009), which was adapted to the context of
classroom rules. Students were presented with the stem ‘I follow my head teacher’s
classroom rules because ... ’ followed by 18 items reﬂecting three types of regulation:
external regulation (6 items; e.g., ‘otherwise I will be punished’), introjected regulation (6

external and introjected rule following were expected to fall in-between both extremes.
These associations were expected to emerge above and beyond students’ background
variables and reasons for (not) studying.
Method
Participants and procedure
This study involved a convenience sample of students from one large public urban
secondary school in Flanders (Belgium) that voluntarily participated in the data collection
as part of a reform trajectory on fostering the motivational climate in the school. All
students within the school were invited to ﬁll out an online survey about experiences with
their head teacher. In a class with alternating teachers for different subjects – as is the case
in secondary schools in Belgium – the head teacher is the primary contact point and
conﬁdential person for students (and their parents) of a speciﬁc class. The head teacher
has the task of monitoring the academic progress and well-being of the students, and
fostering the social relationships and team spirit within the class throughout the school
year. At the moment of data collection, students were approximately 2 months into the
school year.
The sample consisted of 1,006 students (46.7% boys) out of 56 different secondary
school classes taught by a different teacher. The mean age of the students was 14.18 years
(SD = 1.73; range 11 –19 years). Of the sample, 85% had a Belgian nationality, whereas
15% of the students reported to have another, non-speciﬁed nationality. Information
about the socioeconomic status of the students was not available. In terms of education
type, 941 students were enrolled in an academic track (93.5%), whereas 65 students
(6.5%) followed a technical track. On average, students were taught 4.14 hr per week
(range 1 –15 hr) by their head teacher. Participation in the study was voluntary and
conﬁdential, and students could drop out at any time for any reason. A passive parental
consent method was used by distributing a letter to students’ parents explaining the
purposes of the study and providing a method to retract permission. None of the parents
objected to their child participating in the study. In total, 94 students (response rate:
1006/1100 = 91%) did not participate in the survey due to illness or absence for non-
speciﬁed reasons. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Ghent
University.
Measures
Unless mentioned otherwise, students responded to the items on a 5-point Likert scale
ranging from 1 (not at all true for me) to 5 (very true for me). Total scores for each scale
were calculated by averaging across the items.
Internalization of classroom rules
Students’ reasons for following classroom rules were assessed with the Self-Regulation
Questionnaire-Parental Rules (Soenens et al., 2009), which was adapted to the context of
classroom rules. Students were presented with the stem ‘I follow my head teacher’s
classroom rules because ... ’ followed by 18 items reﬂecting three types of regulation:
external regulation (6 items; e.g., ‘otherwise I will be punished’), introjected regulation (6
items; e.g., ‘it makes me feel proud about myself’), and identiﬁed regulation (6 items; e.g.,"
2018 - Correlates of students’ internalization and defiance of classroom rules A self‐determination theory.pdf,"‘I ﬁnd these rules personally meaningful’). Internal consistencies were good with
Cronbach’s alphas of .77, .85, and .87 for external regulation, introjected regulation, and
identiﬁed regulation, respectively.
Deﬁance of classroom rules
Students’ deﬁance of classroom rules was assessed relying on an 8-item scale that was
recently developed to measure secondary school students’ controlled reasons for non-
participation in the context of physical education (Aelterman et al., 2016). For the
purposes of this study, the original scale was adapted as to refer to the context of
classroom rules. Students were presented with the stem ‘I sometimes don’t follow my
head teacher’s classroom rules because ... ’ followed by items representing externally
pressuring (four items; e.g., ‘because then my classmates look up to me’, ‘because the
teacher should not interfere with what I do’) and internally pressuring (4 items; e.g.,
‘because in my opinion only the teacher’s pets always comply with the rules’, ‘because I
have had enough of continuously being a model student’) reasons to not comply with the
head teacher’s rules. The scale had good reliability ( a = .91).
Feelings of resentment
To measure feelings of resentment (six items; e.g., ‘In class I sometimes resent the learning
material’, ‘In class I sometimes get angry at my head teacher’; a = .86), we relied on items
developed by Assor, Roth, and Deci (2004) to assess feelings of resentment towards
parents. These items have been used in previous work in the physical education context
(Aelterman et al., 2016) and were adapted to the present context by changing the
referenced teacher in the item (i.e., from PE to head teacher).
Acting out
The Teacher-Child Rating Scale (T-CRS; Hightower et al., 1987) is a widely used, well-
validated and multidimensional teacher-reported rating scale. In this study, we only
assessed the dimension tapping into students’ acting out (four items; ‘In class I disturb
others while they are working’), thereby adapting the items from a teacher report to a
student self-report format ( a = .77).
Cheating
Students’ cheating behaviour was operationalized by means of a scale adopted from
Anderman, Griesinger, and Westerﬁeld (1998). This 6-item scale ( a = .88) assesses two
aspects of cheating, that is, students’ degree of cheating (e.g., ‘I sometimes cheat when
taking a test or an exam’) and students’ attitudes towards cheating (e.g., ‘It is okay to
cheat’).
Truancy
Similar to previous work (Vansteenkiste et al., 2012), truancy was assessed by asking
students to indicate to what extent they had skipped a class (i.e., one hour) and to what
extent they had skipped a whole school day since the beginning of the school year
(Baerveldt, 1992). Students responded to a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (never), over 1

positively correlated, r = .52, p < .001, and thus taken together into a single truancy
score.
Study motivation
To examine whether students’ internalization and deﬁance of classroom rules accounted
for unique variance in the outcomes beyond students’ study motivation, students’ reasons
for studying were measured to include as covariates in the study. To this, we employed the
20-item Academic Self-Regulation Scale (SRQ-A; Ryan & Connell, 1989), which has
previously been used with primary (e.g., Vandevelde, Van Keer, & Rosseel, 2013) and
secondary school (Vansteenkiste et al., 2009) students. The stem ‘I study for the subject of
my head teacher because ... ’ was followed by 16 items reﬂecting four types of regulation:
external regulation (four items; a = .75; e.g., ‘I’m supposed to do so’), introjected
regulation (4 items; a = .77; e.g., ‘I want others to think I’m smart’), identiﬁed regulation
(four items; a = .82; e.g., ‘I want to learn new things’), and intrinsic motivation (four
items; a = .91; e.g., ‘I’m highly interested in this subject’). In addition, four items tapped
into students’ amotivation (a = .88; e.g., ‘I used to have good reasons to do so, but now I
wonder why I actually study for this subject.’).
Plan of analysis
Preliminary to the main analysis, a conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) based on maximum-
likelihood estimation in M plus was conducted to examine the factorial validity of the full
set of scales included in the present study. In addition, we examined whether the study
variables were associated with student age, and whether there were signiﬁcant
differences according to student sex and educational track.
Because 1006 students were nested within 56 classes (i.e., teachers), multilevel
regression analyses in MLwiN 2.27 (Rasbash, Steele, Browne, & Goldstein, 2014)
were employed to examine the relation of students’ reasons for (not) following
classroom rules with student outcomes. First, a baseline variance components model
or intercept-only model (i.e., null model) was estimated to calculate the intraclass
correlation coefﬁcients for each outcome. Next, in separate models for each of the
outcomes, students’ background variables (i.e., sex, age, and educational track) and
reasons for studying were included simultaneously as control variables in a ﬁrst step
(i.e., Test model – Step 1). In a second step, students’ reasons for following and for
refraining from following rules were entered as predictors into the regression model
(i.e., Test model – Step 2). Herein, both random intercept and random slope models
were tested.

track are presented in Table 1. As can be noticed, mean scores for each of the dependent
variables are fairly low, which indicates that students within the participating school
rarely engage in these behaviours. Further, only 10% and 5% of the students reported
having skipped a class or a whole school day at least once since the beginning of the school
year, respectively. The majority of the students (52%) indicated to not cheat at all when
taking a test or an examination, and over 46% believe it is inappropriate to cheat.

analyses in addition to students’ study motivation variables.
Table 2 presents the latent correlations among the study variables as computed via
CFA. As expected based on previous research (Ryan & Connell, 1989; Soenens et al.,
2009; Vansteenkiste et al., 2014), the three subscales tapping into students’ types of
regulation to follow classroom rules formed a quasi-simplex model. Speciﬁcally, external
rule following related positively to introjected rule following, and less positively to
identiﬁed rule following. Introjected rule and identiﬁed rule following were highly
positively correlated. In addition, consistent with our theorizing that controlled non-rule-
following reﬂects a pressured form of functioning (also see Aelterman et al., 2016), it was
found to be negatively related to identiﬁed rule following, while being positively related to
external rule following. Yet, it was unrelated to introjected rule following. Further,
identiﬁed and introjected rule following yielded a negative association with all student
outcomes, whereas an opposite pattern of correlations was found for external rule
following and controlled non-rule following.
Primary analyses
For all outcome variables, a two-level model with students at Level 1 and teachers at Level
2 yielded a better model than a single-level model, Dv
2(1) ranging between 5.31 for
truancy, p < .05, and 104.63 for cheating, p < .001. In addition, estimation of a fully
unconditional two-level null model (Hox, 2010) and intraclass correlation coefﬁcients
(ICCs) indicated that there was a signiﬁcant difference from zero in variance at the class
level (see Table 3, null model) for feelings of resentment, ICC = 9%, v
2(1) = 19.99,
p < .001, and cheating, ICC = 18%, v2(1) = 16.66, p < .001, but not for acting out
ICC = 3%, v2(1) = 3.47, p = .06, and truancy, ICC = 3%, v2(1) = 3.38, p = .07.
Although there was no signiﬁcant between-class variance for two of four dependent
variables, for the purpose of consistency across models, multilevel modelling was
employed in subsequent analyses for all outcomes as to take into account the hierarchical
structure of the data.
Next, in separate models for each of the outcomes, students’ background variables
(i.e., sex, age, and educational track) and grand mean centred reasons for studying were
included simultaneously as control variables in a ﬁrst step (see Table 3, Step 1). As
intrinsic motivation and identiﬁed regulation are often highly correlated (Calvo, Cervell /C19o,
Jim/C19enez, Iglesias, & Murcia, 2010), and this also was the case in this study ( r = .83,
p < .001; see Table 2), we created a composite score for autonomous study motivation
(a = .91) by averaging both subscales.
Then, students’ grand mean centred reasons for following and for refraining from
following classroom rules were included as Level 1 predictors in a second step (see
Table 3, Step 2). As the focus of the study was on interindividual differences among
students, and not on the estimation of between-classroom differences, we did not include
any Level 2 predictors in our model. Table 3 shows that the inclusion of students’
identiﬁed, introjected, external rule following, and controlled non-rule following (Step 1)
signiﬁcantly ameliorated the model for each outcome compared to the model only
including covariates (Step 1), as the iterated generalized least squares estimation (IGLS
deviance) was signiﬁcant for each of these test models, ranging between Dv
2(4) = 39.34
(in the case of truancy) and Dv2(4) = 135.87 (in the case of resentment), all ps < .001. For
all outcomes, except cheating, identiﬁed regulation to follow classroom rules was
negatively related, whereas no relationships with introjected rule following were found.

analyses in addition to students’ study motivation variables.
Table 2 presents the latent correlations among the study variables as computed via
CFA. As expected based on previous research, the three subscales tapping into students’ types of
regulation to follow classroom rules formed a quasi-simplex model. Speciﬁcally, external
rule following related positively to introjected rule following, and less positively to
identiﬁed rule following. Introjected rule and identiﬁed rule following were highly
positively correlated. In addition, consistent with our theorizing that controlled non-rule-
following reﬂects a pressured form of functioning , it was
found to be negatively related to identiﬁed rule following, while being positively related to
external rule following. Yet, it was unrelated to introjected rule following. Further,
identiﬁed and introjected rule following yielded a negative association with all student
outcomes, whereas an opposite pattern of correlations was found for external rule
following and controlled non-rule following.
Primary analyses
For all outcome variables, a two-level model with students at Level 1 and teachers at Level
2 yielded a better model than a single-level model, Dv
2(1) ranging between 5.31 for
truancy, p < .05, and 104.63 for cheating, p < .001. In addition, estimation of a fully
unconditional two-level null model and intraclass correlation coefﬁcients
(ICCs) indicated that there was a signiﬁcant difference from zero in variance at the class
level (see Table 3, null model) for feelings of resentment, ICC = 9%, v
2(1) = 19.99,
p < .001, and cheating, ICC = 18%, v2(1) = 16.66, p < .001, but not for acting out
ICC = 3%, v2(1) = 3.47, p = .06, and truancy, ICC = 3%, v2(1) = 3.38, p = .07.
Although there was no signiﬁcant between-class variance for two of four dependent
variables, for the purpose of consistency across models, multilevel modelling was
employed in subsequent analyses for all outcomes as to take into account the hierarchical
structure of the data.
Next, in separate models for each of the outcomes, students’ background variables
(i.e., sex, age, and educational track) and grand mean centred reasons for studying were
included simultaneously as control variables in a ﬁrst step (see Table 3, Step 1). As
intrinsic motivation and identiﬁed regulation are often highly correlated , and this also was the case in this study ( r = .83,
p < .001; see Table 2), we created a composite score for autonomous study motivation
(a = .91) by averaging both subscales.
Then, students’ grand mean centred reasons for following and for refraining from
following classroom rules were included as Level 1 predictors in a second step (see
Table 3, Step 2). As the focus of the study was on interindividual differences among
students, and not on the estimation of between-classroom differences, we did not include
any Level 2 predictors in our model. Table 3 shows that the inclusion of students’
identiﬁed, introjected, external rule following, and controlled non-rule following (Step 1)
signiﬁcantly ameliorated the model for each outcome compared to the model only
including covariates (Step 1), as the iterated generalized least squares estimation (IGLS
deviance) was signiﬁcant for each of these test models, ranging between Dv
2(4) = 39.34
(in the case of truancy) and Dv2(4) = 135.87 (in the case of resentment), all ps < .001. For
all outcomes, except cheating, identiﬁed regulation to follow classroom rules was
negatively related, whereas no relationships with introjected rule following were found.

2018 - Correlates of students’ internalization and defiance of classroom rules A self‐determination theory.pdf,"External rule following was positively related to feelings of resentment and cheating, but
unrelated to acting out and truancy. As for controlled non-rule following, a unique positive
association with feelings of resentment, acting out, cheating, and truancy, above and
beyond reasons for following classroom rules was found. The random part of the test
models (Step 2) indicated that the between-student variance explained by students’
reasons for (not) following rules was 11.9%, 12.3%, 11.4%, and 3.3% for feelings of

Finally, random slope models were estimated for each of the outcomes to examine
whether associations between the predictors ( n = 4) and student outcomes ( n = 4)
signiﬁcantly varied as a function of class. Results revealed that associations were largely
similar across classes, with only four of sixteen relationships showing signiﬁcant class-

associations, strength of the relationships varied across classes. In each of these four cases,
the covariance (i.e., relationship between intercepts and slopes) was insigniﬁcant.
Discussion
Grounded in SDT, this study examined students’ underlying reasons for (not) following
established classroom rules in relation to important student outcomes. Several interesting
ﬁndings emerged. First, in line with SDT (Ryan & Connell, 1989) and previous studies
(e.g., Soenens et al., 2009), we found evidence for a distinction between three motives for
following classroom rules that can be ordered along a continuum of increasing
internalization (i.e., external, introjected, and identiﬁed regulation). In addition, building
on prior work (Aelterman et al., 2016), we demonstrated that controlled non-rule
following represents a motivational category that can clearly be discerned from students’
reasons for following the rules. Correlational analyses showed that subtypes formed a
simplex pattern, with subtypes closer to each other (e.g., identiﬁed and introjected rule
following) correlating more strongly than subtypes further apart (e.g., identiﬁed rule
following and controlled non-rule following). In addition, congruent with previous work
(Aelterman et al., 2016), controlled non-rule following was positively correlated with
external reasons for following rules, suggesting that students on average feel simultane-
ously pressured to adhere and to not adhere to rules. Indeed, it makes sense that the
students who at times follow rules for external reasons are the same students who at other
times refrain from following the rules, as both reasons constitute pressured functioning,
yet the pressure manifests differently at the behavioural level. In the case of external rule
following, students give in to the encountered external demands, for example to please
their teacher, while in the case of controlled non-rule following, the pressure is grounded
in opposition against an imposed or internally held demand, with students taking distance
from the teacher (Aelterman et al., 2016). Notably, controlled non-rule following was
unrelated to introjected rule following.
Second, inspecting whether students’ internalization and deﬁance of classroom rules
accounted for unique variance in outcomes revealed that identiﬁed regulation yielded the
most adaptive pattern of functioning. In line with SDT and past research (Roth et al.,

Second, inspecting whether students’ internalization and deﬁance of classroom rules
accounted for unique variance in outcomes revealed that identiﬁed regulation yielded the
most adaptive pattern of functioning. In line with SDT and past research (Roth et al.,"
2018 - Correlates of students’ internalization and defiance of classroom rules A self‐determination theory.pdf,"2011; Soenens et al., 2009; Wentzel et al., 2007), these ﬁndings indicate that if students
follow the classroom rules because they value and fully accept the rules as their own, they
are less likely to feel resentful or to display classroom misbehaviour (e.g., acting out and
truancy). Further, consistent with our predictions and past work (Aelterman et al., 2016),
controlled non-rule following yielded the most maladaptive pattern of outcomes, as
indexed by more resentment, acting out, cheating, and truancy. So, even though
controlled non-rule following is less frequently reported by students, when present, it
relates more strongly to students’ misbehaviour.
As for external regulation, results revealed that students who indicated to follow the
established rules in the classroom to obtain external approval or to avoid punishment,
reported more feelings of resentment and cheating, but not acting out and truancy,
presumably the more problematic outcomes. They may experience more anger and
resentment towards their teacher and engage in subtler and unnoticed problem behaviour
(i.e., cheating), yet, unlike their classmates high on controlled non-rule following, they do
not engage in the more externally visible problem behaviours, like acting out and truancy.
Indeed, as long as the external pressures are operative, students may stick to the
prescribed rules, as also predicted by behaviouristic accounts (e.g., punishment,
reinforcement and extinction; Landrum & Kauffman, 2006). Yet, as can be predicted
on the basis of SDT (Ryan & Deci, 2017) and more preventive approaches towards
classroom management (Korpershoek et al., 2016; Oliver, Wehby, & Reschly, 2011),
such external pressures may come with an affect-related cost, as manifested through
elevated resentment (Shook, 2012).
Notably, following established rules to avoid feelings of guilt and shame (i.e.,
introjected regulation) did not predict any of the outcomes. This null-relation is consistent
with previous studies (Soenens et al., 2009; Wentzel et al., 2007) and can be explained by
the conﬂicting nature of introjected regulation. The established rules are perceived to be
valuable, yet, in contrast with identiﬁed regulation, lack personal meaning such that rule
adherence will require considerable self-control and effort (Vansteenkiste et al., 2018).
Alternatively, some students may also combine introjected and identiﬁed reasons for rule
following. It should be noted, however, that although regression analyses pointed to non-
signiﬁcant unique contribution of introjected regulation, the correlations with feelings of
resentment, cheating, and truancy were all signiﬁcant.
Limitations
The present study has a number of limitations, including the cross-sectional design and the
inclusion of only one urban secondary school. Future research using experimental or
longitudinal designs is needed to examine the causal and long-term effects of students’
internalization and deﬁance of classroom rules in relation to student outcomes. Further,
the involvement of more units at the school-level would allow drawing more generalizable
conclusions about the associations under study.
Second, all data were self-reported, so that some of the associations obtained may be
overestimated due to shared method variance. An important aim for future research is to
adopt a multi-informant approach to assess students’ misbehaviour by also including
teacher reports or peer nominations (e.g., see Wentzel et al., 2007). Furthermore, given
the likelihood that self-reported acting out, cheating, and truancy are sensitive to social
desirability and underreporting, it seems relevant to control for this bias in future studies.
Also, it would be interesting to not only look at students’ engagement in disruptive

The present study has a number of limitations, including the cross-sectional design and the
inclusion of only one urban secondary school. Future research using experimental or
longitudinal designs is needed to examine the causal and long-term effects of students’
internalization and deﬁance of classroom rules in relation to student outcomes. Further,
the involvement of more units at the school-level would allow drawing more generalizable
conclusions about the associations under study.
Second, all data were self-reported, so that some of the associations obtained may be
overestimated due to shared method variance. An important aim for future research is to
adopt a multi-informant approach to assess students’ misbehaviour by also including
teacher reports or peer nominations. Furthermore, given
the likelihood that self-reported acting out, cheating, and truancy are sensitive to social
desirability and underreporting, it seems relevant to control for this bias in future studies.
Also, it would be interesting to not only look at students’ engagement in disruptive"
2018 - Correlates of students’ internalization and defiance of classroom rules A self‐determination theory.pdf,"behaviours, but to include achievement and positive outcomes such as prosociality as
well.
Further, no measurement of amotivation to follow rules was included. In the context of
rule following, amotivation may manifest as the lack of conﬁdence to meet teachers’
expectations or the lack of perceived contingency between the expected behaviour and a
desirable outcome (Ryan et al., 2011). Future studies would do well to also include a
measure tapping into these aspects of amotivation. Along similar lines, it is possible that
apart from controlled reasons for not following the rules, students may also refrain from
rule following for more autonomous reasons. In the case of autonomous non-rule
following, students may have given more consideration to the established rules and may
have volitionally decided to not stick to these rules, because they do not align with their
personal preferences, values, and interests (Aelterman et al., 2016; Vansteenkiste &
Mouratidis, 2016). This issue certainly deserves further exploration.
Finally, one should be aware that (at least some) younger students might struggle with
some concepts, and the measures may require some adjustments for use in younger age
groups. For example, 11-year olds may experience more difﬁculties indicating the extent
to which they ‘ﬁnd these rules personally meaningful’.
Directions for future research
Given that the study of students’ reasons for (not) following classroom rules, and
controlled non-rule following in particular, is still in its infancy, more systematic empirical
work is needed. First, the main purpose of the study was to investigate whether individual
students’ reasons for (not) following rules were related to a variety of student outcomes.
Since these motivational predictors were all Level 1 predictors and we did not include any
between-class (i.e., Level 2) predictors (e.g., L €udtke, Robitzsch, Trautwein, & Kunter,
2009), students were considered as the primary unit of analysis. Yet, variance
decomposition of the outcomes variables revealed that there was signiﬁcant between-
class variance in feelings of resentment (9%) and cheating (18%), so future research is
warranted to explore whether classroom-level factors such as class size or the teacher’s
style of rule setting can account for these between-class differences.
Second, it would be interesting to gain insight into the dynamic relation between the
different reasons for (not) following classroom rules. For example, one avenue for future
research is to investigate whether students high on controlled non-rule following initially
had controlled reasons for following the established rules, but in response to persistent
external pressure gradually shifted into a tendency to resist an overly pressuring teacher.
Possibly, the act of sticking to imposed rules is so energy-consuming that their self-control
gets depleted (DeBono, Shmueli, & Muraven, 2011; Muraven & Baumeister, 2000) and
leads them to oppose the pressuring rules altogether.
Further, it should be noted that students’ reasons for (not) following classroom rules
were assessed with respect to classroom rules in general without deﬁning the speciﬁc
content or nature of these rules. However, within the literature a distinction is made
between organization rules (e.g., raising hands to ask a question, no cheating when taking
a test) and learning rules (e.g., always bringing the handbook to the class, handing in
homework on time) (Gable et al., 2009). Future research could differentiate between
these two categories of classroom rules and examine whether students’ internalization
and deﬁance differ in terms of the category of rules being questioned.
Finally, besides showing that students’ underlying reasons for (not) following
classroom rules account for unique variance in student outcomes, an interesting avenue

2018 - Correlates of students’ internalization and defiance of classroom rules A self‐determination theory.pdf,"for future research is to study the antecedents contributing to the internalization and
deﬁance of classroom rules. According to SDT, the internalization and deﬁance of
classroom rules likely depends on how these rules are established and monitored by the
teacher (Ryan & Deci, 2017). Future research may investigate whether the clarity
(Vansteenkiste et al., 2012) and the style (Reeve, 2009) of rule setting at the beginning of
the school year relate to students’ short- and long-term functioning throughout the year
(Patrick, Turner, Meyer, & Midgley, 2003).
Conclusion
This study demonstrated that students’ reasons for following and refraining from
following classroom rules play a unique role in the prediction of classroom misbehaviour.
To the extent that classroom rules are perceived as personally meaningful and thus have
been fully accepted by students as their own, students will likely display a more adaptive
pattern of outcomes. In contrast, students’ controlled non-rule following is most strongly
predictive of students’ feelings of resentment, acting out, cheating, and truancy.
