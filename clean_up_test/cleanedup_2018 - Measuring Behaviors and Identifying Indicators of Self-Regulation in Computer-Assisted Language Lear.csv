Introduction
More than three decades ago, research into the self-regulation of academic learning and
performance emerged to answer the question of how students become self-regulated
learners. Initial attempts to measure self-regulated learning (SRL) using questionnaires
and interviews were successful in demonstrating significant predictions of students’
academic outcomes (Pintrich et al. 1993; Zimmerman and Pons 1986;S c h u n ka n d
Zimmerman 2012).Recently, researchon SRL has evolved to developonline measures of
self-regulatory processes regarding learning in authentic learning contexts. Unlike self-
reported measures in traditional learning contexts, online measures focus on assessing
self-regulated learning processes and are based on actual learning behaviors in authentic
contexts. Innovative online measures of SRL offer detailed information concerning the
interrelationofvariousprocessesinrealtime,suchascomputertraces(Winneetal. 2006).
In higher education, online learning has fewer restrictions and allows students to learn
at any time and in any place. However, the lower constraints of this learning setting

necessitate self-regulation by students and intrinsic motivation (Goda et al.2015;L y n c h
and Dembo2004; Rakes and Dunn2010). Online learners are required to self-manage
their learning processes and be responsible for initiating, planning, and conducting their
studies.Previousresearchhasshownthatfailuretostudyregularlyleadstopooracademic
achievement,andprocrastinationandwithdrawalhavebeenproventobepersistentprob-
lems in online learning (Elvers et al.2003; Michinov et al.2011). Therefore, the way
in which strategic support and self-regulation of online learners can influence learning
should be investigated to keep students motivated, regulated, and participating in their
courses.
Learning records provide new opportunities to monitor students’ learning process,
as students’ learning behaviors in an online learning environment can be automatically
recorded by online learning systems. According to previous studies utilizing students’
log data, frequency measures are the most typical parameters used to explain individ-
ual differences in online learning (Morris et al.2005). However, several studies claimed
that frequency counts of events were minimally relevant to engaged learning, and they
are limited to suggesting instructional interventions and providing practical learning
guidance (Hrastinski2008; Kirkwood and Price2014). To further understand the pro-
cess of SRL, more elaborate time-based indicators from students’ log data should be
defined.
Inthiscontext,thisstudyaimstomeasureself-regulatedbehaviorsincomputer-assisted
language learning (CALL) courses and identify typical learning patterns, such as pro-
crastination and regular learning. Three novel time-based measures are proposed: (i) a
measure of “anti-procrastination,” that is, whether a student completes the materials in
advance at each course stage and how early the student completes learning materials; (ii)
a measure of “irregularity of study interval,” which means a standard deviation of study
intervals per student on a daily basis; and (iii) a measure of the “pacing” of access, that
is, whether a student is keeping pace with the prescribed flow of materials as the course
proceeds.
Moreover, this study also examines the relationship between behavioral indicators
and learning outcomes, which would contribute to identifying effective self-regulated
behaviorsinanonlinelearningenvironment.
Our research project aims to develop a learning support system for CALL courses to
provide appropriate and customized feedback in a timely manner based on students’
actual learning behaviors. This study, which is as a part of the project, is positioned
to measure behaviors and identify indicators of self-regulation and to determine the

SRL is an active and constructive process through which learners can set goals and
monitor and control their cognition, motivation, and behavior (Pintrich2000). It is
also characterized as a self-directive process, as self-beliefs enable learners to transform
their academic abilities (Zimmerman2008). Winne and Hadwin (1998)p r o p o s e dt h a t
SRL included four phases: defining the task, setting goals and plans, enacting tactics,
and adapting metacognition. Therefore, learners need to analyze the learning context

performance.
Previous studies indicated that SRL is a crucial skill for success in computer-assisted
environments (Adeyinka and Mutula2010). However, learners cannot always regulate
themselves successfully because of reasons, such as lack of good strategy use, lack of
metacognitive knowledge, failure to control metacognitive processes, or lack of experi-
enceinlearningenvironmentswithmultiplerepresentations.
Thus, how to foster SRL ability has become a central issue in the field of educa-
tion research and practice. In order to support learner’s acquisition of self-regulation
skills in CALL courses, instruments that capture students’ self-regulation are critical.
Most studies on self-regulated learning have used self-reported instruments, which
not only are intrusive but also are limited to capturing self-regulated behaviors in
computer-assisted environments. However, as mentioned earlier, this issue can be
resolvedthroughtheuseofonlinetracedata,andtechnologicallymediatedlearningenvi-
ronments enable the collection of a comprehensive set of student learning behaviors that
occur(Pardo 2014).
LearninganalyticsforSRL
As Winne and Baker (2013) noted, “Self-regulated learning is a behavioral expression
of metacognitively guided motivation.” Consequently, every trace records a motivated
choice about how to learn. Analyzing trace data could better understand and discover
meaningfulbehavioralpatternsaboutrateofprogress,effortspent,ortimemanagement.
Numerous studies have reported the benefits of utilizing learning analytics (LA) in
terms of examining online course performance (Johnson 2005; Morris et al. 2005;
DietzUhler and Hurn2013). These results imply that active participation is essential to
successful online learning. Furthermore, a few studies have focused on the quality of
learningratherthanthenumberofonlineparticipation(AsartaandSchmidt 2013;Cheng
and Chau2016). Asarta and Schmidt were particularly interested in the timing dimen-
sion of access to 36 online lesson materials. They examined the effect of timing, volume,
intensity,andconsistencyofaccessonachievement.Theyclarifiedthatkeepingpacewith
the class schedule, studying the materials in advance of an exam without cramming, and

Despite a growing body of research that examines interpreting online engagement to
support the learning process in online learning environments, little is known on how to
measure self-regulated learning and to examine the effects on course success. Yet, inter-
preting and evaluating qualities of actions, strategies, goals, and more broadly regulation
isamuchmorechallengingtask(Rolletal. 2014).Developingindicatorsofself-regulated
learning is the first step to addressing this challenge. The extraction and aggregation of
meaningful indicators should support understanding of students’ learning statuses and

Settingandparticipants
Fifty mandatory CALL courses at a national university in Japan were employed in this
research. The courses were provided to freshman students for self-regulated learning
fromthespringsemestertothefallsemester.Table 1showsthecourseschedulefor1year.
To increase students’ motivation, four sub-deadlines were set in each semester. Students
were required to complete the assigned materials from the first stage to the third stage,
withthefourthstageasanoptionaloneineachsemester.
The e-learning materials of the CALL course contained grammar, listening, and read-
ing sections. A total of 973 quiz units were included, with 493 quiz units in the spring
semester and 480 quiz units in the fall semester, respectively. The difficulty of e-learning
materialsincreasedstagebystage.Table 2indicatesthedetailsofthee-learningmaterials.
A total of 2631 freshman students participated in this study. Students were from all
departments of the Art and Science faculties. Eighty-four students (3.19%) dropped out
and did not access the learning materials at all during the whole year. Additionally, 93

Datacollectionandmeasures
The freshman students conducted the CALL course ona language learning management
system named WebOCM, and the system had a function for tracing students’ events.
As students practiced quizzes online, the learning events were recorded in the server
logs concurrently. Therefore, the trace data was retrieved from the server of the CALL

behavioralmeasuresderivedfromthe rawdata,and variables8and9 areusedfor course
achievement.
Of particular interest in this study is the measuring of self-regulation patterns from
the trace data such as procrastination and regular learning. Thus, three measures were
specificallycreatedtoidentifyself-regulationpatterns.
Thefirstmeasureis“anti-procrastination.”Itiscalculatedbycomparingthetotalavail-

AP =

whereN is the number of completed quizzes,ai is one quiz unit,Dai is the days between
the completed day of the quiz unit and the first day of the stage when the quiz unit is
completed, andDis thetotaldaysofthestage.Foreachquizunit,ascorerangingfrom0
to 1 is decided by comparing the completed day with the first day of the related stage. As
showninFig. 2,thestudentwhocompletedallquizunitsjustatthefirstdayofeachstage
would receive the highest possible value of 1; however, one who completed all quiz units
just before the deadline of each stage would receive the lowest value of 0. Therefore, the
anti-procrastinationmeasurewasusedtodeterminewhetherthestudentscompletedthe
quizunitsinadvanceandhowearlythestudentscompletedthequizunits.
Thesecondmeasureistheirregularityofstudyinterval.Itmanifestshowstudyintervals
are dispersed. First, a set of daily activities of accessing learning materials were extracted
per student. The study intervals in daily activities were then calculated. Finally, the stan-
dard deviation of study intervals per student was computed. A student who regularly
learns would get a low score of the irregularity of study interval measure. This measure
wasusedtodeterminethedegreeofcontinuouslearning.
The third measure is “pacing.” It refers to a count of the number of quiz units that
werecompletedasassigned.Asnotedearlier,acoursescheduleinformedstudentsofthe
online materials that should be completed before the four given sub-deadlines. Ideally,
students should complete quiz units stage by stage rather than cramming with all quiz
units within several days. Thus, a value of 1 would be recorded to the pacing measure if
the student completed one quiz unit within the scheduled stage. A high pacing measure
wouldindicatethatthestudentwaskeepingthelearningpaceastheassignmentschedule.

Finally, two exam points were used to evaluate the effects of learning pace patterns on
student performance. The examinations were administered through an offline campus
at the end of the spring and fall semester, respectively. They were graded in the form of
five letter grades: A, B, C, D, and F. This grading scale is commonly used, where topical

Descriptivestatistics
Table4 contains descriptive statistics for all behavioral variables. The mid course point
(M = 3.3, SD= 1.0) and final course point (M = 3.2, SD= 1.1) had high mean values
and indicates that the majority of students completed the course with high points. Addi-
tionally, the reviewing time (M = 2.8, SD= 4.3) and anti-procrastination (M = 0.27,
SD = 0.14) varied widely. The distribution of the score of completed quizzes (Skew-
ness =− 0.28) was close to a normal distribution, whereas the distribution of the
irregularity of study intervals (Skewness= 2.01) was skewed to positive. The results
revealed that the majority of students completed the course with wide differences in
learningpaceaswellastimemanagement.
Resultsofclusteringanalysis
Two measures were used in the cluster analysis: anti-procrastination and number of
completedquizzes.
In order to determine the optimal number of clusters for thek-means algorithm, two
main evaluation methods were computed: the elbow method and the silhouette method.
Accordingtotheresultingevaluation,7waschosenastheoptimumnumberofclusters.

A beta coefficient compares the strength of the effect of one behavioral variable to the

be periodically reminded to access the online materials at the remaining stages. At the
end of learning, these measures are helpful to evaluate self-regulated learning behaviors
for learners as well as for instructors. For example, a score of self-regulation could be
sent to facilitate students’ self-reflection by integrating learning pacing, consistency, and
completeness.
