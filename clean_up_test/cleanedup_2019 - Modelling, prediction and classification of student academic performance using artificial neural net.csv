Abstract
The conventional statistical evaluations are limited in providing good predictions of the university educational quality. 
This paper presents an approach with both conventional statistical analysis and neural network modelling/prediction of 
students’ performance. Conventional statistical evaluations are used to identify the factors that likely affect the students’ 
performance. The neural network is modelled with 11 input variables, two layers of hidden neurons, and one output layer. 
Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is employed as the backpropagation training rule. The performance of neural network 
model is evaluated through the error performance, regression, error histogram, confusion matrix and area under the 
receiver operating characteristics curve. Overall, the neural network model has achieved a good prediction accuracy of 
84.8%, along with limitations.

1 Introduction
The academic achievement of university students is the 
most important benchmark to compare the quality of uni-
versity students. It serves as the basic criteria for univer -
sity to monitor the quality of teaching and learning and 
for university to evaluate and select students. Nowadays, 
most universities are facing tough challenges to attract 
prospective students due to increasingly highly competi-
tive educational markets. Therefore, the study of students’ 
academic achievements is of great significance in promot-
ing the student developments and the improvement of 
higher education quality. However, the student perfor -
mance is influenced by many factors in a complicated 
manner, and the student socio-economic background 
and their historical academic performance may poten -
tially affect their academic performance. Unsurprisingly, 
most existing research works have been limited to analys-
ing and predicting students’ performance in a relatively 
simple problem formulation using statistical techniques.
To cope with such limitation, machine learning has 
been increasingly used in the data science applications 
to analyse complex relationships. It is capable of learning 
automatically without being programmed explicitly. An 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, even though has 
long established history in computing and data science, 
is gaining growing attention and wide applications. ANN 
extends the capability of analysing complicated amount 
of data sets that are not easily to be simplified through 
the conventional statistical techniques. It has also the abil-
ity to implicitly detect non-linear relationships between 
dependent and independent variables [1 ]. ANN has been 
gaining wider attention and has proven a great success 
in the application of pattern recognitions, classifications, 
forecasting and prediction in the areas of healthcare, cli-
mate and weather, stock markets, etc.

2  Artificial neural network
Artificial Neural network (ANN) is a powerful and com-
plex modelling tool for modelling nonlinear functions 
that often describes the real world systems [ 2–4]. ANN 
is formed through a collection of artificial neurons that 
resemble the connection geometry of neurons in human 
brains in order to execute a task with improved per -
formance through ‘learning, training and continuous 
improvement [2, 5, 6].
ANNs are formed with three layer neuron structures, 
namely the input, hidden (middle) and output layers. 
The input layer gathers numerical information data with 
feature sets and activation values. Input values are propa-
gated through the interconnected neurons to the hidden 
layer. In the hidden layer, the input neurons are summed in 
order to compute weighted sum of the input neurons; and 
summed neurons are further combined to produce results 
in the output layer using an activation (or transfer) func -
tion [5, 7]. Both neurons and connection contain adjust -
able weights during the learning process. The summed 
neurons will transform mathematically in the output layer 
if the activation function threshold is exceeded.
A number of times the training functions are used to 
update the connection weights in the process of feed-
ing the input values and terminating with output values 
in ANN is called an Epoch [7 ]. This is where the inputs 
of artificial neurons are multiplied by weights, and the 
resultant of these summation are fed to the output layer 
through an activation function [6]. The frequently used of 
activation functions include linear, sigmoid and hyper -
bolic tangent functions. The training terminates when the 
maximum epoch value and/or the validation checks are 
reached. The resultant trained data is fed into the test data 
in order to examine the ANN’s performance.
The most common learning rule of ANNs is back-prop-
agation (BP), which is a supervised learning approach 
and can be used for training the deep neural networks. 
BP adjusts the weights of neurons through the calculated 
errors and enables the network to learn from the training 
process. Typical problem solving of ANNs include three 
archetypes of learning, i.e. supervised learning, unsuper -
vised learning and reinforcement learning [6].
Remarkably, ANN approach has been receiving wide 
attention for educational research purposes. [ 2] applied 
ANN to model and perform data training based on stu-
dents’ course selection behaviour, and further identified 
the best strategy and configuration to meet students’  
demands for every courses for optimal course scheduling 
within a university. ANN was used in classifying students 
within the musical faculty to predict the perceptions of 
students’ in music education [4]. ANN was combined with 
particle swarm optimisation to assess performance of lec-
turers and also to enhance the accuracy of the recognition 
in the university’s lecturer assessment system [7 ]. An arti-
ficial intelligence (AI) procedure based on self-organising 
neural network model was proposed by [8 ] that auto -
matically characterised bibliometric profiles of academic 
researchers and further identify institutions that had simi-
lar pattern of academic performance among researchers. 
Additionally, different prediction models other than ANN 
technique such as discriminant analysis, random forests, 
and decision trees were applied by [5 ] in predicting and 
classifying the academic performance of students in three 
different universities.
ANN was also used to model and simulate diversity 
of learning style among students through two learning 
paradigms namely the supervised (learning with teacher) 
and unsupervised learning (learning without teacher and 
through students’ self-study) [9 ]. Similarly, [10] proposed 
an Artificial Intelligence-based tool that took into account 
ANN as one of the Artificial Intelligence methods in mini-
mising disorientation of learning behaviour and over -
loaded cognitive problems among students. In the tool, 
the ANN performed better compared with other learning 
models applied. Additionally, a BP-based ANN was applied 
in evaluating the quality of the teaching system and the 
ANN performance was able to meet the requirements of 
the system’s feasibility and precisions [3 ]. Although the

grades, low prediction accuracies were obtained as the 
result. The paper by [11] successfully applied ANN to pre -
dict the student’s mood during self-assessment online test,

text. This paper has therefore proposed the use of ANN as 
an application modelling tool for predicting the academic 
performance among students. Unlike the modelling con-
cepts as outlined in the literature, the paper focuses on the 
students’ socio-economic background and their entrance 
examination results that likely would affect their overall 
academic performance in a university. This is important 
not only to examine the significant factors that affect the 
performance among students, but also to classify students’ 
performance correctly based on the predicted pattern 
obtained from ANN. As the prediction performance may 
be greatly reduced by huge discrepancies of samples from 
different universities [5 ], this paper would only focus on 
data samples from one single university in order to ensure 
the prediction accuracy of academic performance. The 
modelled ANN model would serve as a framework and tool 
to predict the future students’ academic performance, and 
to further address those issues that hinder the success of 
student learning and thus continually improving the edu-
cational quality.
3  Methodology
This section presents the methodology of acquiring edu-
cational data, statistical hypothesis testing for neural net-
work modelling, and the methodology of evaluating the 
performance of modelled ANN.
3.1  Educational data collection
The sample data were collected about a total of 1,000 
students consisting of 275 female and 810 male students 
selected from the undergraduate students from University 
Q. The examination results comprised three undergradu-
ate programs within three departments of the university 
for the student intakes from year 2011 to 2013, with four 
year in total courses for each year of intake. In addition, 
the sample data of students’ socio-economic background 
and national university entrance examination results were 
also collected. The entrance examination results included 
five core subjects: Chinese, English, Math, Comprehensive 
Science and Proficiency Test. The student performance was 
determined using the standardised Cumulative Grade 
Point Average (CGPA) for the entire four year duration of 
their studies. It is calculated as the weighted average of 
the grade point gained:
where 
c i denotes the credit hours per course i and g i is the 
grade point received per course i.
3.2  Statistical hypothesis testing
Prior to the ANN modelling, it is necessary to examine the 
relationship between the socio-economic, family and edu-
cation background of students and their academic per -
formance. Statistical evaluations are performed initially in 
this study, including correlations, two-sample t -test and 
ANOVA (single factor). Pearson correlation coefficients 
are calculated to measure the linear the relationships of 
five core entrance examination subjects and the resultant 
CGPA. Those correlated variables are used further as input 
neurons for the ANN modelling. For t-test and ANOVA, a 
significance level of p = 0.05 is chosen to test the signifi-
cant difference, notably the mean CGPA difference in two 
or more sample groups. Hypothesis testing in this case 
is performed to test whether male and female students, 
geographical locations, roles of parents, types of students 
have significant influence on the resultant CGPA.
3.3  Neural network modelling
ANN in this case is used for neural prediction of students’ 
CGPA and the data classification of data through input 
observations. Both schemes are performed based on 
supervised machine learning. The ANN in this paper is 
modelled following the earlier research works [5 , 7, 13]. 
It is not the scope of this paper to compare the effective -
ness of ANN performance with other machine learning 
techniques.
Typically, the ANN model can simply be expressed as a 
mathematical function:
where 
̃/u1D418 and ̃/u1D417 are the output and input vectors.  ̃/u1D416 is a 
vector of weight parameters representing the connections 
within the ANN.
The input layer gathers data with feature sets and the 
input values are fed to the hidden layer. The output values

of jth neuron y j of vector ̃/u1D418 are computed by means of the 
weighted sum of input elements x and w:
The /u1D703 is the activation function (transfer function), N i is 
the total number of ith connection lines to the jth neuron 
and x i is the output value from the previous layer of i th 
neuron. The activation function ( /u1D703 ) of hyperbolic tangent 
is used to transfer the value of weighted sum of inputs to 
the output layer. The resultant activated node for the next 
input layer is therefore:
In order to reduce the dimensionality of the predictor 
space and to prevent the possibility of over-fitting, prin-
cipal component analysis (PCA) is employed [14]. PCA is a 
data reduction technique that transforms predictors lin-
early, removes any redundant dimensions, and generates 
new sets of variables called as principal components [14].
The BP-based supervised learning approach is applied 
where both inputs and outputs parameters are supplied to 
the ANN model. BP is used as the learning rule for the ANN 
model that adjusts the weights of neurons 
w ij through the 
errors computed that further produces desired outputs. 
The error function (E) of computed BP-based ANN is calcu-
lated as the sum of square difference difference between 
the and the target values and the desired outputs:
where 
tj is the target value for neuron i in the output layer 
and N j is the total number of output neurons.
In ANN weights are updated recursively. The BP-based 
Levenberg–Marquardt optimisation algorithm is applied 
in the ANN training. The Levenberg–Marquardt is a hybrid-
based training method using the steepest descent (gradi-
ent descent) and Gauss-Newton method. It speeds up the 
convergence to an optimal solution and therefore is effec-
tive in solving non-linear problems over the other train-
ing algorithms [15, 16]. The algorithm introduces another 
approach of approximation to Hessian Matrix, which is 
similar to the Gauss-Netwon method [15, 17]:
where J denotes the Jacobian matrix, 
ek is the error in 
the network [17], w ij is the current weight and w ij is the 
updated weight, /u1D701 is the damping factor.
When /u1D701 is small, the Levenberg–Marquardt training 
algorithm in Eq. (6 ) is based on Gauss-Newton method,

and in contrast, becomes gradient descent algorithm 
when 
/u1D701 is large. Therefore, /u1D701 is adjusted at every iteration 
in order to guide the optimisation process and switched 
between those two algorithms.
The number of neuron in the output layer is the result-
ant decision prediction of the problem [4 ]. The output 
layer consists collections of vector 
̃/u1D418 , which is the collec -
tion of predicted CGPA.
3.4  ANN performance evaluation criteria
For the later data analysis, in order to evaluate the per -
formance of ANN, this paper introduces several new per -
spectives that mitigates the arising of over-fitting issues 
to ensure the appropriateness of ANN performance. The 
evaluation includes the computation of Mean Square 
Error (MSE), regression analysis, error histogram and con-
fusion matrix. A well-trained ANN model should have low 
MSE value (close to zero), which means that the predicted 
outputs converge closely to the target outputs 
(tij) . MSE 
is calculated as:
As mentioned, an over-fitting of the trained network is 
possible if obtained MSE value is low. This further indicates 
that ANN only works well in the training stage, but not in 
validation and testing phase. To mitigate this a regression 
is performed along with computed R-value which dem-
onstrates the goodness of fitting between the predicted 
and the desired outputs [18]. The plot is useful in examin-
ing the fitting performance. If poor fitting (low R-value) is 
obtained, further trainings are required with modification 
of hidden layers and neurons.
As mentioned, another way of measuring ANN perfor -
mance is to tabulate the error histogram. The error histo -
gram demonstrates how the errors are distributed with 
most errors are occurred near zero. The error is simply the 
difference between the targeted outputs 
tij and the pre -
dicted outputs y ij.
In order to verify ANN’s performance in terms of clas-
sifications, a confusion matrix (also known as error matrix) 
is used. A confusion matrix of a binary classification, is a 
two-by-two table showing values of True Negatives (TN), 
False Negatives (FN), True Positives (TP) and False Posi-

.","The /u1D703 is the activation function (transfer function), N i is 
the total number of ith connection lines to the jth neuron 
and x i is the output value from the previous layer of i th 
neuron. The activation function ( /u1D703 ) of hyperbolic tangent 
is used to transfer the value of weighted sum of inputs to 
the output layer. The resultant activated node for the next 
input layer is therefore:
In order to reduce the dimensionality of the predictor 
space and to prevent the possibility of over-fitting, prin-
cipal component analysis (PCA) is employed. PCA is a 
data reduction technique that transforms predictors lin-
early, removes any redundant dimensions, and generates 
new sets of variables called as principal components.
The BP-based supervised learning approach is applied 
where both inputs and outputs parameters are supplied to 
the ANN model. BP is used as the learning rule for the ANN 
model that adjusts the weights of neurons 
w ij through the 
errors computed that further produces desired outputs. 
The error function (E) of computed BP-based ANN is calcu-
lated as the sum of square difference difference between 
the and the target values and the desired outputs:
where 
tj is the target value for neuron i in the output layer 
and N j is the total number of output neurons.
In ANN weights are updated recursively. The BP-based 
Levenberg–Marquardt optimisation algorithm is applied 
in the ANN training. The Levenberg–Marquardt is a hybrid-
based training method using the steepest descent (gradi-
ent descent) and Gauss-Newton method. It speeds up the 
convergence to an optimal solution and therefore is effec-
tive in solving non-linear problems over the other train-
ing algorithms. The algorithm introduces another 
approach of approximation to Hessian Matrix, which is 
similar to the Gauss-Netwon method:
where J denotes the Jacobian matrix, 
ek is the error in 
the network, w ij is the current weight and w ij is the 
updated weight, /u1D701 is the damping factor.
When /u1D701 is small, the Levenberg–Marquardt training 
algorithm in Eq. (6 ) is based on Gauss-Newton method, 
and in contrast, becomes gradient descent algorithm 
when 
/u1D701 is large. Therefore, /u1D701 is adjusted at every iteration 
in order to guide the optimisation process and switched 
between those two algorithms.
The number of neuron in the output layer is the result-
ant decision prediction of the problem. The output 
layer consists collections of vector 
̃/u1D418 , which is the collec -
tion of predicted CGPA.
3.4  ANN performance evaluation criteria
For the later data analysis, in order to evaluate the per -
formance of ANN, this paper introduces several new per -
spectives that mitigates the arising of over-fitting issues 
to ensure the appropriateness of ANN performance. The 
evaluation includes the computation of Mean Square 
Error (MSE), regression analysis, error histogram and con-
fusion matrix. A well-trained ANN model should have low 
MSE value (close to zero), which means that the predicted 
outputs converge closely to the target outputs 
(tij) . MSE 
is calculated as:
As mentioned, an over-fitting of the trained network is 
possible if obtained MSE value is low. This further indicates 
that ANN only works well in the training stage, but not in 
validation and testing phase. To mitigate this a regression 
is performed along with computed R-value which dem-
onstrates the goodness of fitting between the predicted 
and the desired outputs. The plot is useful in examin-
ing the fitting performance. If poor fitting (low R-value) is 
obtained, further trainings are required with modification 
of hidden layers and neurons.
As mentioned, another way of measuring ANN perfor -
mance is to tabulate the error histogram. The error histo-
gram demonstrates how the errors are distributed with 
most errors are occurred near zero. The error is simply the 
difference between the targeted outputs 
tij and the pre -
dicted outputs y ij.
In order to verify ANN’s performance in terms of clas-
sifications, a confusion matrix (also known as error matrix) 
is used. A confusion matrix of a binary classification, is a 
two-by-two table showing values of True Negatives (TN), 
False Negatives (FN), True Positives (TP) and False Posi-
tives (FP) resulting from predicted classes of data. 
The confusion matrix allows the measures of rates such as 
prediction accuracy, error rate, sensitivity, specificity and 
precision, which are included in this paper (Refer [21] 
for calculations of the rates derived from confusion 
matrix). Furthermore, a Receiver Operating Characteristic"

Curve (ROC) is also employed that detects the trade-off  
between the TP rate and FP rate, and also the area under 
the ROC curve (AUC) [20]. ROC is widely used in machine

4  Results
This section presents the statistical findings, the ANN con-
figuration and the performance based on the obtained 
yearly academic performance educational data of 1,000 
students (175 female and 810 male students) for the intake 
year 2011–2013 from the University Q.
4.1  Statistical evaluations
Figure 1 presents the performance of yearly students’ aver-
age CGPA for the intake year of 2011–2013. Additionally, 
the ANOVA for three consecutive academic performance 
years with 
p < 0.05 indicates that there is significant differ-
ence of students’ yearly CGPA performance, with notable 
improvements in their performance for next two academic 
years.
Two-sample t-tests are performed in three types of 
sample data to test the null hypotheses concerning the 
students’ gender, location, and repeating students.
Table 1 shows the t -test result of CGPA performance 
based on students’ gender. Since 
p < 0.05 , there is a sig-
nificant differences of CGPA performance for male and 
female students, where in this case female students score 
better than male students. Table 2 presents another t-test 
of CGPA performance of students based on urban and 
rural settlements. The t-test results with 
p > 0.05 con -
cludes that there is no significant difference of CGPA per -
formance based on different settlement types. Finally, the 
t-test result with p < 0.05 in Table 3 indicates that mean 
CGPA performance of current and repeating students is 
statistically significant, with current students score better 
than repeating students.
Correlation test is performed to examine the degree of 
closest relationship among the entrance subject exami-
nation results and the CGPA result. The correlation coef-
ficients between five entrance examination subjects and 
the CGPA performance are shown in Table 4, with descend-

Figure 1 presents the performance of yearly students’ aver-
age CGPA for the intake year of 2011–2013. Additionally, 
the ANOVA for three consecutive academic performance 
years with 
p < 0.05 indicates that there is significant differ-

Two-sample t-tests are performed in three types of 
sample data to test the null hypotheses concerning the 
students’ gender, location, and repeating students.
Table 1 shows the t -test result of CGPA performance 
based on students’ gender. Since 
p < 0.05 , there is a sig-
nificant differences of CGPA performance for male and 
female students, where in this case female students score 
better than male students. Table 2 presents another t-test 
of CGPA performance of students based on urban and

formance based on different settlement types. Finally, the 
t-test result with p < 0.05 in Table 3 indicates that mean 
CGPA performance of current and repeating students is

than repeating students.
Correlation test is performed to examine the degree of

ANOVA tests are performed to examine the effects of 
parent’s occupation on the resultant students’ CGPA. The 
parents’ occupation is classified into five categories and 
the effects of mother and father’s occupation in affect -
ing the students’ performance are separately evaluated, 
with corresponding results as shown in Tables  5 and  6. 
The 
p < 0.05 in Table 5 indicates that the students’ CGPA 
are significantly affected by mothers’ occupation. It can 
be inferred that one of students’ great achievements are 
based on motivations from their mother. Additionally, 
it can be explained by that mothers are typically more 
concerned about academic performance among their 
children, hence influence a lot on students’ performance. 
In contrast, there is no significant difference ( 
p > 0.05 ) of 
students’ mean CGPA based on fathers’ job occupation as 
shown in Table 6, where fathers’ motivation are not suffi-
ciently strong enough to improve academic performance 
among students. It is not the scope in this paper to further 
evaluate the mean difference of individual job units within 
parents and the resultant CGPA.
4.2  ANN configuration settings
The ANN modelling and evaluations are performed using 
MathWorks MATLAB software. The input layer consists 
of 11 variables about students’ background and their 
entrance exam results, with the background information 
including gender, location, whether or not repeating stu-
dents, previous school area, parent’s occupation, and the 
entrance exam results including Chinese, English, Maths, 
Comprehensive Science and Proficiency test. The mod-
elled ANN has two hidden layers, where each hidden 
layer consists of 30 neurons as such configuration pro -
vides the best outcome throughout several simulations 
with different hidden layer and neuron settings. Each 
hidden layer with 30 neurons is fed into a single output 
neuron that carries the decision of the variable, which is 
the prediction of students’ CGPA.
The activation function of hyperbolic tangent is used. 
Decisions must be taken to divide the dataset into train-
ing, validation and test ratio. Data samples of 1,000 stu-
dents are randomly mixed and 0.7 of the mixed samples 
are used for training, 0.15 used for validation and the 
remaining 0.15 used for the testing. By following [14], 
PCA is kept only enough components to explain 95% of 
the variance.
During the training and learning phase, Leven-
berg–Marquardt algorithm in Eq. (6 ) is used to deter -
mine the optimal weights that are fed to the next input 
layer. The damping factor 
/u1D701 is set to 0.001. The training 
epoch is set to 1500. The ANN training performs continu-
ously and terminates when the validation error failed to 
decrease for six iterations during the validation process. 
Typically, the validation protects over-training of ANN.

4.3  ANN simulation results
After the ANN training, PCA is able to keep five compo -
nents, and the explained variance per component (in 
order) is: 62.9%, 16.6%, 8.8%, 5.1%, 2.8%, 2.2%, 0.9%, 
0.6%, 0.1%, 0% (where variances of least important com-
ponents are hidden from display). The ANN performance 
with MSE 
≈ 0.27 or 6.9%  ( < 10% ) indicates the sufficiently 
good performance of ANN in completing training training 
and validation runs.
Regression plots of ANN performance are shown 
in Fig. 2. For a good data fitting, the data should have the 
predicted outputs 
y ij lying closely with target outputs tij . In 
this case, the resultant regression plots achieve marginally 
good fits with an.overall R-value of 0.64.
The error histogram evaluates the error distributions 
based on the resultant ANN predictions. The distribution of 
errors are shown in Fig. 3. Most errors occurred near zeroth 
point (horizontal axis), and errors are gradually decreas-
ing when moving away from zeroth point. This proves that 
ANN performs the prediction successfully with acceptable 
error distributions as shown in Fig. 3.
Figure 4 presents the results of the confusion matrix for 
a binary classifier resulting from two classes (students’ gen-
der). As can be seen, 136 out of 249 male students and 712 
out of 751 female students have been classified correctly.

5  Conclusion
In this paper ANN is used to evaluate and predict the stu-
dents’ CGPA using the data about their socio-economic 
background and entrance examination results of the 
undergraduate students from a Chinese university. The 
initial stage involves statistical analyses of the students’ 
background information have indicated significant 
improvement in the case of yearly students’ CGPA ; female 
students scoring significantly better than male students; 
there is no significant difference of students’ performance 
from rural and urban areas; and non-repeating students 
performing significantly better than repeating students. 
The correlation analysis indicates that the English exam 
result in the entrance examination has the strongest cor -
relation with the student’s CGPA. Students’ mother play a 
significantly more important role in the students’ academic 
performance than father.
In order to evaluate the performance of ANN, compu-
tations of Mean Square Error (MSE), regression analysis, 
error histogram and confusion matrix are introduced to 
ensure the appropriateness of ANN’s performance in miti-
gating the arising of overfitting issues. Overall, the ANN 
has achieved a good prediction accuracy of 84.8%, and 
with good AUC value of 0.86. The good ANN performance 
makes ANN such a useful technique for education evalua-
tion purposes. However, ANN performs poorly in classifica-
tions of students according to their gender, as high False 
Negative (FN) rates are obtained as results. This is likely 
due to high imbalance ratio of two different types of sam-
ple data (students’ gender) applied. Such shortcomings 
can be mitigated by introducing new samples with more 
balanced type of sample populations.

In the light of the results, it is strongly believed that 
education modelling settings using ANN can help to 
evaluate students’ performance. The future models 
may include other attributes such as the lecturers’ role, 
additional curricular classes, course feedbacks and 
e-learning system are immediate tasks in order to com-
plement a complete ANN modelling, while focusing on 
ANN’s prediction accuracy. We strongly believe that the 
future education with Artificial Intelligence-based ana-
lytics setting can further enhance the capability of stu-
dents in achieving high academic performance within 
academic institutions.

Fig. 6  ROC curve of ANN. AUC-area under the ROC Curve","In the light of the results, it is strongly believed that 
education modelling settings using ANN can help to 
evaluate students’ performance. The future models 
may include other attributes such as the lecturers’ role, 
additional curricular classes, course feedbacks and 
e-learning system are immediate tasks in order to com-
plement a complete ANN modelling, while focusing on 
ANN’s prediction accuracy. We strongly believe that the 
future education with Artificial Intelligence-based ana-
lytics setting can further enhance the capability of stu-
dents in achieving high academic performance within 
academic institutions.
