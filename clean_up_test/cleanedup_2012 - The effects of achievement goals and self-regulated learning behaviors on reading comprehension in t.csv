abstract
Studies examining students’ achievement goals, cognitive engagement strategies and performance have
found that achievement goals tend to predict classes of cognitive strategy use which predict performance
on measures of learning. These studies have led to deeper theoretical understanding, but their reliance on
self-report data limit the conclusions that can be drawn. We employed a behavioral approach instead and
assessed learning processes by logging learners’ behaviors as they used educational technology. We
examined the relationship between achievement goals, strategy use, and comprehension scores of 160
undergraduates who studied a hypertext passage in a technology-enhanced learning environment (TELE)
equipped with tools that support learning behaviors including highlighting, taking notes, review of anno-
tations, seeking additional information and monitoring understanding. Results of a path analysis indi-
cated that higher mastery goals predicted more information-seeking and note-taking and marginally
more monitoring of learning. Performance avoidance goals negatively predicted note-taking and informa-
tion-seeking. Performance approach goals did not predict the behaviors we traced. Of the behaviors we
traced, highlighting and monitoring predicted increases in comprehension scores. A behavioral approach
to assessing learning processes conﬁrmed only a subset of paths from achievement goals to learning pro-
cesses to learning outcomes originally discovered with self-report data.

1. Introduction
A recent literature review (Linnenbrink-Garcia, Tyson, & Patall,
2008) and meta-analysis ( Hulleman, Schrager, Bodmann, &
Harackiewicz, 2010) indicate that the evidence for relationships
between learners’ mastery approach and performance approach
goals and achievement is mixed; some studies ﬁnd a relationship
and others show none. These syntheses of research suggest a
tentative relationship between achievement goals and learning
outcomes that needs to be examined further. Though achievement
goals have not consistently been found to predict achievement
directly, these goals play an important role in the self-regulated
learning process. According to theories of self-regulated learning
(SRL; Pintrich, 2000a; Winne & Hadwin, 1998, 2008; Zimmerman,
2000, 2011), the goals that learners set motivate the behaviors that
are responsible for bringing about learning; if learners adopt goal
orientations that motivate them to engage in effective learning
strategies, learning is likely to result.
Many prior studies have examined how learning processes medi-
ate the relationship between achievement goals and outcomes,
describing these learning processes as instances of cognitive
engagement, self-regulation of learning, or strategy use. These stud-
ies have tested models of increasingly complex sets of potential
mediating processes in order to improve our understanding of the
relationship between learner’s achievement goals, learning pro-
cesses and outcomes. A sample of such work can be found inTable

predicts learning. A second set of studies examined types of cogni-
tive engagement and found that the use of meaningful, deep cogni-
tive strategies is both predicted by mastery goals and positively
predictive of performance. Performance approach goals predicted
the use of both deep and shallow strategies, but these shallow strat-
egies negatively predicted performance. This added distinction led
to a more speciﬁc understanding of the effect of achievement goals
on students’ cognitive strategy use, as did additional studies that

1. Introduction
A recent literature review (Linnenbrink-Garcia, Tyson, & Patall,
2008) and meta-analysis ( Hulleman, Schrager, Bodmann, &
Harackiewicz, 2010) indicate that the evidence for relationships
between learners’ mastery approach and performance approach
goals and achievement is mixed; some studies ﬁnd a relationship
and others show none. These syntheses of research suggest a
tentative relationship between achievement goals and learning
outcomes that needs to be examined further. Though achievement
goals have not consistently been found to predict achievement
directly, these goals play an important role in the self-regulated
learning process. According to theories of self-regulated learning
(SRL; Pintrich, 2000a; Winne & Hadwin, 1998, 2008; Zimmerman,
2000, 2011), the goals that learners set motivate the behaviors that
are responsible for bringing about learning; if learners adopt goal
orientations that motivate them to engage in effective learning
strategies, learning is likely to result.
Many prior studies have examined how learning processes medi-
ate the relationship between achievement goals and outcomes,
describing these learning processes as instances of cognitive
engagement, self-regulation of learning, or strategy use. These stud-
ies have tested models of increasingly complex sets of potential
mediating processes in order to improve our understanding of the
relationship between learner’s achievement goals, learning pro-
cesses and outcomes. A sample of such work can be found inTable

that tracing learning behaviors may prove to be an informative
method of examining how learners’ achievement goals prompt the
use of speciﬁc strategies that impact learning. As we will describe,
previous attempts to investigate these relationships are limited by
their use of instruments that require learners to self-report general
statements describing their strategy use. This practice is compli-
cated by researchers’ operational deﬁnitions of constructs and the
scales they use to represent them and learners ability to accurately
characterize their strategy use.
1.1. Varying approaches to representing cognitive strategy use
Across studies examining achievement goals and cognitive
strategy use, the scales used to represent a type of cognitive
engagement differ. When a researcher conceives of a study, speciﬁc
hypotheses are to be tested, and the methods used to test these
hypothesis shape the design of assessments. This is a productive
approach at the level of an individual study, but synthesizing re-
sults across numerous studies is difﬁcult when researchers opera-
tionally deﬁne and assess similarly named constructs using
different scales. For instance,Greene and Miller (1996)conducted
a study that investigated achievement goals’ effect on deep and
shallow cognitive strategies and assessed each using items from
the Motivation and Strategy Use Scale (Greene & Miller, 1993).
Sample items in the study used to represent deep cognitive strate-
gies included language referencing elaboration, organization and
metacognitive monitoring. Items representing shallow strategy
use included language about memorization strategies like rehear-
sal. In another study examining deep and shallow strategies,
Dupeyrat and Mariné (2005)represented deep cognitive strategies
with the Elaboration and Organization scales from the Motivated
Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ; Pintrich, Smith,
Garcia, & McKeachie, 1991) and scales reﬂecting memorization
strategies like rehearsal to represent shallow cognitive strategies.
While their instruments differ, their distinction between strategy
classes is analogous. Conversely, a study by Wolters (2004)
examined cognitive versus metacognitive strategies, but did not
distinguish amongst shallow versus deep strategies. In that study,
cognitive strategies were represented by MSLQ Rehearsal (a shal-
low strategy in the ﬁrst two studies) and Elaboration (previously
a deep strategy) scales. Metacognitive strategies were represented
by an MSLQ scale of the same name. A fourth study (Vrugt & Oort,
2008) examined deep, shallow and metacognitive strategies.
However, this deﬁnition of deep cognitive strategies was reﬂected
by use of Elaboration, Organization and Critical Thinking scales
from the MSLQ, while surface cognitive strategies were repre-
sented by scores on the Rehearsal scale. Examining the alignment
of scales to constructs across these four studies, one can see how a
researcher’s experimental design decisions make synthesis
challenging. Not unexpectedly, ﬁndings across these studies are
not perfectly aligned.
Looking at the effect of these strategies on performance,Greene
and Miller (1996), Dupeyrat and Mariné (2005), and Vrugt and
Oort (2008) all found that mastery goals predicted deep strategy
use, but only Greene and Miller (1996) found deep cognitive

signiﬁcant and positive association between cognitive strategies
and math grades, which might lead us to believe the additional
construct used to assess cognitive strategies, rehearsal, might be
responsible for this ﬁnding – except thatVrugt and Oort (2008)
found that rehearsal, their surface cognitive strategy scale, nega-
tively predicted performance on a psychology exam. It is difﬁcult
to determine what to make of these ﬁndings given the differences
in the way constructs were represented across studies.
A key issue here is the categorization of constructs into groups
of strategies that are explicitly deep or shallow. While distinctions
between cognitive and metacognitive strategies are rooted in cog-
nitive theory, the theoretical basis for distinguishing between deep
and shallow strategies is less robust. As a result, alignment of con-
structs to deep or shallow categories varies by study. In the ab-
sence of a strong, consistent, and theory-driven rationale for
categorizing constructs as deep or shallow cognitive strategies, it
is probably best to examine constructs and their role as mediators
between achievement goals and learning outcomes on an individ-
ual basis. By choosing not to assign constructs to larger categories,
results of studies can be more easily compared and conclusions
about the role of individual strategies can be drawn. These conclu-
sions might also be made more reliably if researchers would use
measures that directly assess the strategic behaviors they intend
to measure with self-report instruments. A second issue with the
use of self-report scales to assess strategy use involves learner’s
capacity to accurately report the behaviors the scales are designed
to assess.
1.2. Calibration and accuracy of self-reported strategy use
It has been demonstrated on more than one occasion that learn-
ers, in an attempt to describe their tendencies to self-regulate
learning, tend to misrepresent themselves (Bråten & Samuelstuen,
2007; Winne & Jamieson-Noel, 2002). Studies comparing logs of
learners’ behaviors to measures of their self-reported strategy
use show learners’ recall of strategy use to be inaccurate, and that
they commonly overestimate how frequently they employ
strategies.
Some of this inaccuracy may be due to the desire to report the
value of a strategy in addition to the frequency it is used. When
measured with surveys, students may indicate that they perceive
the value of a strategy, but in reality do not employ it because it
requires a lot of effort. Prior work examining effort and the per-
ceived value of strategies ﬁnds that when a behavioral measure
of effort is included with self-reports of value placed on strategies,
the behavioral measure is more predictive of learning than are self-
ports of strategy use (Dupeyrat & Mariné, 2005). For these reasons,
as well as those outlined in Section 1.1, we advocate a different ap-
proach to assessing strategy use. We suggest an alternate approach
to trusting respondents to accurately report their behaviors. It re-
quires that we examine learners’ behaviors ourselves and infer
the cognitive processes these behaviors represent. This would
eliminate bias stemming from learners’ beliefs about the value of
strategies and would also avoid misrepresentation of learning
behaviors that derive from students’ difﬁculty making accurate
assessments about their own learning behaviors.
1.3. A behavioral approach to assessment of strategy use
Given the problems with self-report measures of cognitive
strategy use, it may be time to consider assessing students’ strat-
egy use by examining behavioral logs that trace the timing and fre-
quency of behaviors indicative of a strategy. When learners
conduct a behavior, it indicates both their perceived value of the
behavior and their willingness to put forth the effort required to
conduct it. The explicit measurement of instances of behavior al-
lows us to determine the frequency of behaviors and infer the
strategy or strategies they may reﬂect.
In this study, we captured evidence of student behavior using
log-ﬁle analysis and drew inferences from records of their behav-
iors regarding their use of particular learning strategies. This meth-
od provided concrete deﬁnitions of learning behaviors that can be
inferred as representative of one or more cognitive or metacogni-
tive processes. While behaviors must be interpreted in the context
of the learning environment in which they occur, this behavioral
approach is free from bias due to learners’ inaccurate estimation
of their own behaviors common to self-report methods.
1.4. Cognitive measures of learning
In addition to employing a behavioral approach to assess strat-
egy use, we took a cognitive approach to assess learning. Since we
are examining how motivational constructs like achievement goals
inﬂuences cognitive processes, it makes sense to deﬁne perfor-
mance on learning tasks in cognitive terms. By examining the
learning process in this way, we were able to appraise a set of
authentic behaviors indicative of learners’ strategy use and gauge
the beneﬁt of each behavior for different types of learning. In the
next few sections, we review how self-regulated learning theory
and achievement goal theory ground our study, then detail the
beneﬁts and early successes of a behavioral approach to measuring
learning behavior. First, however, we provide a brief overview of
Kintsch’s (1998) Construction-Integration Theory of Comprehen-
sion, which served as a basis for our measures of textbase and sit-
uation model learning.
2. Construction-integration model of comprehension
In this study, prior knowledge and learning were measured in
terms of initial comprehension of the reading passage and increases
in comprehension using
Kintsch’s (1998)Construction-Integration
Model (C-I). This model describes reading comprehension as a cycli-
cal process of constructing and integrating the propositions that
appear in a passage into atextbase that readers elaborate upon
using prior knowledge and experience to form asituation model.
The textbase is described as the ‘‘elements and relations that are di-
rectly derived from the text itself’’ (Kintsch, 1998, p. 103) and can be
equated with declarative knowledge such as facts and deﬁnitions. A
more complex level of comprehension is the situation model.
Learners’ situation model comprehension is built by activating prior
knowledge, identifying causal linkages between nodes of text, and
by creating elaborative inferences based on prior knowledge, indi-
vidual text pieces, the tone of the text, and so on. In contrast to text-
base knowledge, situation model comprehension can be equated
with conceptual knowledge. Measurement aligned to the Construc-
tion-Integration Model examines two levels of comprehension and
allows for the teasing out of effects of motivation and SRL strategies
on basic retention and deeper levels of comprehension.
3. Achievement goals
3.1. Achievement goals deﬁned
Over multiple decades of research on achievement goal orienta-
tions, both mastery goals and performance goals (Elliot, 1999) have
been associated with one’s level of performance in academic tasks.
Alternate formulations to mastery/performance goal deﬁnitions
include task/ego goals (Maehr & Nicholls, 1980) and learning/
performance goals (Dweck, 1986). Keeping to the mastery/perfor-
mance framework that has been commonly used in recent reviews

Linnenbrink-Garcia et al., 2008; Senko, Hulleman, & Harackiewicz,
2011), those who adopt mastery goals aim to develop competence
by focusing on learning and compare current levels of competence
to previous levels. Those pursuing performance goals instead focus
on demonstrating their competence, often comparing themselves
to others.
Both mastery and performance dimensions can also be investi-
gated along an approach versus avoidance dimension (Elliot &
McGregor, 2001). One who adopts a performance approach orien-
tation aims to demonstrate competence by performing better than
others whereas the goal of one who adopts a performance avoid-
ance orientation is to avoid performing worse than others. A mas-
tery approach oriented learner seeks to improve competence
compared to prior levels. While mastery approach goals have been
well documented, research conﬁrming the existence, relevance and
appropriate interpretation of mastery avoidance goals within a
context is just emerging (Baranik, Stanley, Bynum, & Lance, 2010;
Madjar, Kaplan, and Weinstock, 2011). For this reason, we con-
strain our focus in this study to a trichotomous model including
mastery approach, performance approach and performance avoid-
ance goals.
3.2. Multiple goal theory
Research has also revealed that learners’ endorsement of
achievement goals tend to correlate signiﬁcantly ( Barron &
Harackiewicz, 2001). For instance,Murayama, Elliot, and Yamagata
(2011) found that, across numerous studies where conﬁrmatory
factor analyses demonstrate the constructs are distinct, learners’
performance approach and avoidance goals tend to be highly cor-
related. A theory of multiple goals has emerged to explain ﬁndings
like this (Harackiewicz, Barron, Pintrich, Elliot, & Thrash, 2002;
Pintrich, 2000b; Senko et al., 2011) and holds that pursuing multi-
ple goals may confer beneﬁts to learners that may be integrative or
additive (Senko et al., 2011). In this study, we use path analysis to
reﬂect how individual goals inﬂuence strategy use and perfor-
mance. This technique also allows one to observe any additive
effects that occur when a learner endorses more than one achieve-
ment goal.
3.3. Relationship with cognitive strategy use and achievement
Recent reviews of the achievement goal literature suggest that
both mastery and performance goals are associated with achieve-
ment in learning tasks (Hulleman et al., 2010; Linnenbrink-Garcia
et al., 2008). Linnenbrink-Garcia et al. (2008)found that both mas-
tery approach and performance approach goals correlated with
measures of performance in roughly 40% of studies, while achieve-
ment goals were non-signiﬁcantly related in the remaining sixty
percent of studies. When signiﬁcant correlations were found, the
effect sizes associated with these correlations suggest that one’s
achievement goals have only a modest effect on the outcomes of
engaging in a task. Similarly, a meta-analysis conducted by
Hulleman and colleagues (2010) found that mastery goals were
positively related to achievement. Performance goals, however,
were positively related to achievement when measured by items
that reﬂect a desire for normative comparison, but were negatively
related to achievement when deﬁned by a concern about one’s
appearance (i.e. looking smart). These reviews conﬁrm a positive
relationship between mastery and performance approach goals
and achievement, but the degree to which achievement goals pre-
dict achievement is limited. When considering the complexities of
the learning process, it makes sense that merely possessing
achievement goals should not lead directly to achievement.
According to theories of self-regulation, in addition to having a
goal, one must conduct some type of cognitive process to achieve
competence in a task.
4. Theoretical framework of self-regulated learning
Multiple theorists including Pintrich (2000a), Winne and
Hadwin (1998, 2008)and Zimmerman (2000, 2011)have theorized
that individuals who approach learning tasks in a thoughtful and
strategic way are more likely to increase their knowledge.Pintrich
(2000a) identiﬁes this as a tendency to self-regulate learning (SRL)
and deﬁnes SRL as an ‘‘application of general models of regulation
and self-regulation to issues of learning, in particular, academic
learning that takes place in school or classroom contexts’’ (p.
451). Winne and Hadwin (1998)offer a description of self-regu-
lated learning as an event-based phenomenon that occurs in
weakly sequenced phases. When learners self-regulate, they (1)
deﬁne the task at hand, (2) set goals that they would like to attain
and develop a plan for their attainment, (3) enact those tactics, and
(4) monitor their progress towards goal attainment against a pre-
conceived set of internal standards. Within each phase, self-regula-
tory behaviors are governed by a collection of conditions that
describe a context where operations generate products that are
evaluated in light of learners’ standards.Winne (1997) describes
this element of the theory as the COPES architecture.Zimmerman
(2000) describes a similar series of phases in the SRL process,
which include a period of forethought, performance and self-reﬂec-
tion, and also articulates that SRL processes require an initial and
sustained level of motivation (Zimmerman, 2011) to proceed.
5. Measurement of self-regulated learning
Early research on SRL tended to employ questionnaire instru-
ments such as the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire
(Pintrich et al., 1991). More recently, ofﬂine measures like ques-
tionnaires have been discussed as being less valid indicators of
strategy use than online measures that take into account a given
context (Zimmerman, 2008). Studies conducted by Winne and
Jamieson-Noel (2002)and Bråten and Samuelstuen (2007)provide
evidence that ofﬂine self-regulated learning measurement has
faults and demonstrate a lack of calibration between what learners
believe they do when completing tasks and what they actually do.
Further, they argue that measuring self-regulated learning using
insufﬁciently contextualized items renders the authenticity and
validity of such results suspect. More recent studies of self-regu-
lated learning tend to employ event-based measurement strategies
in the form of trace methodologies (Winne, 2006) and think-aloud
protocols (e.g. Greene & Azevedo, 2009). These methods capture
SRL strategies as they are being employed, which bothZimmerman
(2008) and Winne (2010)suggest provide heightened authenticity
in their identiﬁcation of strategy use. Both methods are common
among researchers who study SRL in computer-based learning
environments, as can be seen by articles detailing the strength of
think-aloud methodologies ( Greene, Robertson & Costa, 2011 )
and log analyses (Hadwin, Nesbit, Jamieson-Noel, Code, & Winne,
2007) for these contexts.
As compared to the cumbersome process of transcribing think
aloud data (Greene & Azevedo, 2009), the development of environ-
ments that record learners’ actions as they occur has made conve-
nient the process of data collection, allowing for examination of
large samples of students’ behaviors in technology-enhanced
learning environments. Embedded data collection tools compile
time-stamped logs of learner actions in the environment, which
can be queried to produce indicators of speciﬁc occurrences
(Winne, 2010) or patterns of occurrences. An occurrence is a trace
that indicates a learner has conducted a behavior that is inferred to

ciﬁc point in the task. Analysis of this indicator can ensue and re-
search questions that examine how such user actions inﬂuence
learning can be addressed. This study employs alog analysisfeature
of Winne, Hadwin and Beaudoin’s (2009)nStudy browser to trace
occurrences of SRL behaviors and examines whether occurrences
of SRL behaviors are more common in the presence of an achieve-
ment orientation and whether they affect learning.
Prior research has examined individual behaviors representa-
tive of self-regulated learning strategies and tested the relation-
ships between these behaviors and learners’ achievement goals.
Using gStudy (an Internet-based learning environment and precur-
sor to the tool used in this study),Nesbit, Winne, Jamieson-Noel,
and colleagues (2006) assessed students’ highlighting and note-
taking behaviors as a function of their achievement goals. Over
the course of studying an educational psychology chapter in the
gStudy environment, students had the opportunity to use tools
provided by gStudy that included a highlighter and a note-taking
feature that allowed for free form and structured note-taking. Data
were collected via behavioral logs. Results using traces of students’
annotations indicated that Nesbit and colleagues correctly hypoth-
esized that students reporting higher mastery goals demonstrated
a greater frequency and sophistication of note-taking and a lower
frequency of highlighting terms without using the note tool to
elaborate on them. In this study, we examined students’ achieve-
ment goals and the utilization of these and other features in a dif-
ferent task. We traced the frequency of a larger set of behaviors
and analyzed relations between achievement goals, learning
behaviors reﬂective of cognitive strategies, and performance on a
posttest measuring comprehension.
6. Hypotheses
We designed the path model inFig. 1 based on prior ﬁndings
regarding the relationship between achievement goals, learning
behaviors, and performance in achievement tasks. While many of
our hypotheses have been previously tested in earlier studies, this
study is novel and warranted for three reasons. First, this study
reexamines prior work investigating relationships between
achievement goals, cognitive strategy use, and performance using
behavioral data instead of self-report, thus avoiding the associated
susceptibility to inaccuracy of self-reports. Second, we examine the
impact of strategies used on two different measures of comprehen-
sion, which can provide deeper insight into the kinds of learning
that different strategies promote. Third, we simultaneously model
learners’ mastery approach, performance approach and perfor-
mance avoidance goals, allowing us to predict the behaviors and
outcomes of learners who adopt each goal to a speciﬁc degree
(Senko et al., 2011) when engaging in a learning task. Because re-
search has shown that learners tend to pursue multiple goals and
that pairs of goals can correlate highly, it is important to consider
these goals not in isolation, but as a constellation of learner goals,
adopted with various strengths that simultaneously impact the
behaviors of the learner in the environment. The results we obtain
from this approach can reﬁne our conception of the relationships
between learners’ achievement goals and the speciﬁc learning
behaviors they motivate, and can also indicate the degree to which
these goals and behaviors affect performance in a learning task.
6.1. Predictors of strategy use
In line with Dweck’s (1999) descriptions of the behaviors of
mastery learners, and Pintrich’s explanation that mastery-oriented
individuals tend to employ learning strategies (2000b, p. 473), we
anticipated that those adopting mastery goals would demonstrate
greater tendency towards the cognitive strategies studied previ-
ously (Table 1). Mastery learners are apt to report using cognitive
and metacognitive strategies (Vrugt & Oort, 2008; Wolters, 2004),
but the use of self-report items reﬂecting classes of strategies and
not individual behaviors has precluded examination of more spe-
ciﬁc actions learners take when engaged in a task. In this study,
we expected mastery learners to be more apt to use strategies like
taking notes, reviewing notes, accessing elaborated explanations of

2012 - The effects of achievement goals and self-regulated learning behaviors on reading comprehension in t.pdf,"the reading topic, monitoring progress using a checklist of learning
objectives. Behavioral data provides evidence of these behaviors,
which we infer to be reﬂective of cognitive strategies including
organization (some note taking) and elaboration (some note taking,
seeking information) and metacognitive monitoring (reviewing
annotations, monitoring progress). Our model tested these speciﬁc
hypotheses by examining paths from mastery goals to each ‘‘deep’’
self-regulated learning strategy that could be traced in the learning
task we provided. Additionally, we tested a path from mastery ori-
entation to highlighting, which might be construed as a deep, shal-
low or metacognitive process.
As a learning strategy, highlighting has been theorized as indic-
ative of a superﬁcial strategy in some cases (Nesbit et al., 2006).
Others have theorized that behaviors similar to highlighting might
lead to the use of deeper strategies (Greene, Miller, Crowson, Duke,
& Akey, 2004). It stands to reason that, if this latter hypothesis is
true, highlighting might predict situation model learning, and mas-
tery learners might demonstrate this behavior en route to engaging
in deeper learning behaviors. As a result, we tested a path from
mastery goals to highlighting, as well as a path from highlighting
to other strategies (note-taking and review of annotations).
Because achievement goals have been known to correlate and
because multiple goal theory suggests that pursuit of multiple goals
might confer beneﬁts, we also examined paths from performance
approach goals to strategy use. However, little in the environment
should cue students to consider their peers’ performance or their
perception of their performance; the task was completed on an
individual basis and performances were not made public. Since par-
ticipants were made aware of these features, we made no hypoth-
eses about performance approach or avoidance goals on the
grounds of theory, but did attempt to replicate ﬁndings from prior
research. Performance approach goals have been associated with
both deep and shallow cognitive strategies, so we estimated paths
from performance approach goals to all learning behaviors. Those
with strong performance avoidant goals have been found to self-re-
port lower levels of strategy use (Shih, 2005). To determine what
learning strategies these individuals tend to avoid, we estimated
paths from performance avoidance to all traced behaviors.
6.2. Predictors of comprehension
Our comprehension measure yields subscores for textbase com-
prehension, which reﬂects retention of the text, as well as situation
model comprehension, which reﬂects one’s ability to make infer-
ences by drawing on retention of multiple portions the text and
prior knowledge (Kintsch, 1998). As a result, we can test hypothe-
ses about the effect of predictors on each type of comprehension.
We hypothesized that highlighting, if it is indeed a shallow tactic
associated with retention but not deep understanding asNesbit
(2006) and colleagues describe, would predict textbase compre-
hension. We also tested whether highlighting would predict situa-
tion model comprehension since rehearsal practice may
strengthen retention of segments of text needed to generate infer-
ences. Based on prior evidence from multiple studies of self-regu-
lated learning (e.g.Azevedo & Cromley, 2004; Greene & Azevedo,
2007, 2009) we tested paths indicating that self-regulated learning
strategies would predict comprehension at the textbase and situa-
tion model levels. In order to examine relationships between
achievement goals and achievement recently summarized by
Linnenbrink-Garcia et al. (2008), we also tested direct paths from
each achievement goal to each comprehension subscale.
6.3. Role of prior knowledge
In previous research examining the effect of prior knowledge on
self-regulated learning behaviors (e.g.Moos & Azevedo, 2008) prior
knowledge was found to be a signiﬁcant predictor of monitoring,
but to predict lower amounts of other strategy use. Prior knowl-
edge was also found to predict posttest performance. We include
these paths in our model as well, though we do not make any addi-
tional hypotheses with respect to relationships between prior
knowledge and achievement goals.
Our path model is a fully saturated model in which all paths
from exogenous variables (achievement goals and prior knowledge
variables) to endogenous learning behaviors and comprehension
scores are estimated, as are all paths from these learning behaviors
to each comprehension score. We test additional paths from learn-
ing behaviors that are theorized to be more superﬁcial than others
(highlighting to note-taking) and paths from highlighting and
note-taking to review of annotations since one must make an
annotation in order to review it. Model identiﬁcation and model
ﬁt are discussed in the results section.
7. Methods
7.1. Participants
One hundred and sixty (n = 160) participants enrolled in eight
sections of undergraduate education courses from a large Mid-
Atlantic public university completed the study. The participants re-
ceived extra credit for participating in the study. One hundred and
eighty-six students out of the 263 who were invited to participate
accepted (response rate = 71%). One hundred and sixty of them
completed all measures and compose the ﬁnal sample (adjusted
response rate = 61%). For these 160 participants, there was no
missing data. Their average age was 21.75 years old (SD = 3.60)
and they had completed 3.75 semesters (SD = 1.78) of post-second-
ary education. Seventy-two percent were female (n = 115) and
81.3% were Caucasian (n = 130). Their self-reported mean GPA
was 3.17 (SD = .39) and their self-reported mean SAT verbal and
math scores were 576 ( SD = 74.06) and 548 ( SD = 81.80),
respectively.
7.2. Measures
Participants completed a battery of measures prior to the learn-
ing task including a demographic survey, a pretest knowledge
measure (administered again at posttest to measure learning),
and the Achievement Goals Questionnaire-Revised ( Elliot &
Murayama, 2008).
7.2.1. Prior knowledge and learning measures
A knowledge measure was designed speciﬁcally for this study
and was administered before and after the task to assess textbase
(16 multiple choice items) and situation model (four essay items)
comprehension as described byKintsch (1998). Textbase items as-
sessed recall of facts that appear in the reading (Sample item: ‘‘The
most common medication prescribed for treatment of ADHD is
[answer choices: stimulant
⁄; depressant; anti-depressant; anxiolit-
ic]) Situation model items assessed respondents’ ability to draw
inferences from the reading and to accurately and completely
compose an explanation of how multiple portions of the reading
relate to a topic. The essay items were coded using a three-point
scale (0, 1, and 2) to correspond to learners’ answers demonstrat-
ing no, partial and complete comprehension of an aspect of the
reading passage (Sample Item: ‘‘How would you characterize the
recent trends in ADHD diagnosis?). Using a holistic rubric, two
independent raters scored each response. A Kappa statistic (j)
was calculated for each of four situation model items. Coefﬁcients
ranged from j = .762 to j = .918, with the lower bound of the
lowest conﬁdence interval equal to .700.

low or metacognitive process.
As a learning strategy, highlighting has been theorized as indic-
ative of a superﬁcial strategy in some cases.
Others have theorized that behaviors similar to highlighting might
lead to the use of deeper strategies. It stands to reason that, if this latter hypothesis is
true, highlighting might predict situation model learning, and mas-
tery learners might demonstrate this behavior en route to engaging
in deeper learning behaviors. As a result, we tested a path from
mastery goals to highlighting, as well as a path from highlighting
to other strategies (note-taking and review of annotations).
Because achievement goals have been known to correlate and
because multiple goal theory suggests that pursuit of multiple goals
might confer beneﬁts, we also examined paths from performance
approach goals to strategy use. However, little in the environment
should cue students to consider their peers’ performance or their
perception of their performance; the task was completed on an
individual basis and performances were not made public. Since par-
ticipants were made aware of these features, we made no hypoth-
eses about performance approach or avoidance goals on the
grounds of theory, but did attempt to replicate ﬁndings from prior
research. Performance approach goals have been associated with
both deep and shallow cognitive strategies, so we estimated paths
from performance approach goals to all learning behaviors. Those
with strong performance avoidant goals have been found to self-re-
port lower levels of strategy use. To determine what
learning strategies these individuals tend to avoid, we estimated
paths from performance avoidance to all traced behaviors.
6.2. Predictors of comprehension
Our comprehension measure yields subscores for textbase com-
prehension, which reﬂects retention of the text, as well as situation
model comprehension, which reﬂects one’s ability to make infer-
ences by drawing on retention of multiple portions the text and
prior knowledge. As a result, we can test hypothe-
ses about the effect of predictors on each type of comprehension.
We hypothesized that highlighting, if it is indeed a shallow tactic
associated with retention but not deep understanding asNesbit
(2006) and colleagues describe, would predict textbase compre-
hension. We also tested whether highlighting would predict situa-
tion model comprehension since rehearsal practice may
strengthen retention of segments of text needed to generate infer-
ences. Based on prior evidence from multiple studies of self-regu-
lated learning we tested paths indicating that self-regulated learning
strategies would predict comprehension at the textbase and situa-
tion model levels. In order to examine relationships between
achievement goals and achievement recently summarized by
Linnenbrink-Garcia et al. (2008), we also tested direct paths from
each achievement goal to each comprehension subscale.
6.3. Role of prior knowledge
In previous research examining the effect of prior knowledge on
self-regulated learning behaviors prior
knowledge was found to be a signiﬁcant predictor of monitoring,
but to predict lower amounts of other strategy use. Prior knowl-
edge was also found to predict posttest performance. We include
these paths in our model as well, though we do not make any addi-
tional hypotheses with respect to relationships between prior
knowledge and achievement goals.
Our path model is a fully saturated model in which all paths
from exogenous variables (achievement goals and prior knowledge
variables) to endogenous learning behaviors and comprehension
scores are estimated, as are all paths from these learning behaviors
to each comprehension score. We test additional paths from learn-
ing behaviors that are theorized to be more superﬁcial than others
(highlighting to note-taking) and paths from highlighting and
note-taking to review of annotations since one must make an
annotation in order to review it. Model identiﬁcation and model
ﬁt are discussed in the results section.
7. Methods
7.1. Participants
One hundred and sixty (n = 160) participants enrolled in eight
sections of undergraduate education courses from a large Mid-
Atlantic public university completed the study. The participants re-
ceived extra credit for participating in the study. One hundred and
eighty-six students out of the 263 who were invited to participate
accepted (response rate = 71%). One hundred and sixty of them
completed all measures and compose the ﬁnal sample (adjusted
response rate = 61%). For these 160 participants, there was no
missing data. Their average age was 21.75 years old (SD = 3.60)
and they had completed 3.75 semesters (SD = 1.78) of post-second-
ary education. Seventy-two percent were female (n = 115) and
81.3% were Caucasian (n = 130). Their self-reported mean GPA
was 3.17 (SD = .39) and their self-reported mean SAT verbal and
math scores were 576 ( SD = 74.06) and 548 ( SD = 81.80),
respectively.
7.2. Measures
Participants completed a battery of measures prior to the learn-
ing task including a demographic survey, a pretest knowledge
measure (administered again at posttest to measure learning),
and the Achievement Goals Questionnaire-Revised.
7.2.1. Prior knowledge and learning measures
A knowledge measure was designed speciﬁcally for this study
and was administered before and after the task to assess textbase
(16 multiple choice items) and situation model (four essay items)
comprehension as described byKintsch (1998). Textbase items as-
sessed recall of facts that appear in the reading (Sample item: ‘‘The
most common medication prescribed for treatment of ADHD is
[answer choices: stimulant
⁄; depressant; anti-depressant; anxiolit-
ic]) Situation model items assessed respondents’ ability to draw
inferences from the reading and to accurately and completely
compose an explanation of how multiple portions of the reading
relate to a topic. The essay items were coded using a three-point
scale (0, 1, and 2) to correspond to learners’ answers demonstrat-
ing no, partial and complete comprehension of an aspect of the
reading passage (Sample Item: ‘‘How would you characterize the
recent trends in ADHD diagnosis?). Using a holistic rubric, two
independent raters scored each response. A Kappa statistic (j)
was calculated for each of four situation model items. Coefﬁcients
ranged from j = .762 to j = .918, with the lower bound of the
lowest conﬁdence interval equal to .700."
2012 - The effects of achievement goals and self-regulated learning behaviors on reading comprehension in t.pdf,"In order to test hypotheses, scores forprior knowledgeand learn-
ing were calculated. Textbase prior knowledge scores were calcu-
lated by tallying the number of multiple-choice items answered
correctly (out of 16). Situation model prior knowledge scores were
calculated by summing the number of points awarded by raters
across the four situation model items (out of 8). We deﬁned learn-
ing in this task as the degree to which a learner acquired new
knowledge that was not previously possessed prior to engaging
in the task. Textbase learning scores were determined by calculat-
ing the number of items correctly answered on the posttest that
were not answered correctly on the pretest. That is, if a learner cor-
rectly answered 10 of 16 items on the pretest (prior knowledge
score = 10), the learning score was calculated as the proportion of
remaining six items correctly answered at posttest (e.g. 0 of 6 cor-
rect meaning 0% of potential learning occurred; 6 of 6 = 100%). This
percentage represents the extent to which a learner’s chosen ap-
proach advanced their comprehension of the reading passage to-
wards a criterion of complete comprehension of the reading
passage (i.e. mastery).
We acknowledge that for those accustomed to pre-post differ-
ence scores, this method requires a different type of interpretation.
Whereas difference scores represent straight increases in perfor-
mance, we sought to examine the proportion of potential learning
that resulted from engaging in the learning task. By calculating
learning as we did, we changed the way one examines outcomes
from a linear increase in performance to a proportion of mastery
of new knowledge each learner achieved. In order to help readers
gauge the effect that completing the learning task had on compre-
hension, we included pretest and posttest means and standard
deviations in Table 3. The difference between these mean scores
on pretest and posttest indicate a large effect of the learning exer-
cise on textbase (d = 2.92) and situation model comprehension
scores (d = 1.40). By that measure, increases in performance are
considerable. When examining such increases as measures of
learning according to our deﬁnition, we found that, for this sample
of learners, the mean textbase learning score was M = .802
(SD = .170). After completing the learning task, the typical partici-
pant correctly answered 80% of items that they previously an-
swered incorrectly, or that they learned 80% of the materials that
were possible to be learned. The mean situation model learning
score wasM = .463 (SD = .247), meaning a typical learner correctly
earned 46% of points which were not earned on the pretest essays.
7.2.2. Achievement goal orientation
The Achievement Goals Questionnaire-Revised ( Elliot &
Murayama, 2008) is a 12-item measure that assesses learners’
orientation according to a 2/C22 model. Subscales for each achieve-
ment goal are composed of three items that are Likert scored from
1 to 7 (Sample items ‘‘My aim is to completely master the material
presented in this class’’; mastery approach; ‘‘My goal is to avoid
performing poorly compared to others’’; performance avoidance).
In this study, the coefﬁcient alphas for each scale range from
a = .763 to a = .817 across mastery approach, performance ap-
proach and performance avoidance subscales included in the anal-
yses. Items referred to achievement goal statements with respect
to ‘‘this class.’’ Students were reminded both during recruitment
and prior to completion of survey measures that the passage was
selected to correspond to course readings, and that they should
treat the task as they would any other assignment for their course.
7.3. Materials
7.3.1. Learning task
Learners were given 20 min to study a 1050-word text passage
taken from a human development textbook (Berk, 2006) and an
additional 307-word passage taken from the webpage of Division
12 of American Psychological Association summarizing a selection
of childhood disorders. The topic of the reading passage from the
textbook (Berk, 2006) was Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD), which was a topic included in the syllabus of all courses
from which students were sampled.
The reading passage was broken up across a set of ﬁve pages of
content with links to an additional ten pages that deﬁned terms in
the main reading. Users could navigate to these deﬁnition pages
via the hyperlinked word in the main passage. In addition to the
content pages, a Learning Goals page and a Study Checklist page in-
cluded a number of speciﬁc learning objectives, which appeared
alternately as a list of learning goals and as a checklist for review.
These were included in order to track planning and monitoring
behavior, though no student accessed the Learning goals page prior
to visiting the ﬁrst content page. As a result, planning using the
Learning Goals page was not analyzed.
7.3.2. NStudy
The computer-based learning environment employed in this
study was nStudy (Winne et al., 2009). NStudy is an Internet-based
learning environment through which learners can navigate to any
webpage and can browse its contents. The nStudy environment
provides students with tools they can use to interact with the web-
page such as highlighters, note templates, a glossary, a link creator,
and an information panel that records their marks on the webpage
content to facilitate review of marks and links made. NStudy then
tracks learners’ activities within the webpage and creates a time
stamped log of learner actions. This log ﬁle can be used to analyze
the occurrence, frequency, timing and pattern of learner behaviors.
Additional tools available in nStudy that were not available to stu-
dents for this study include a concept map and search tool, as well
as collaborative tools like chat and help functions. A screen shot of
the nStudy environment appears inFig. 2. Before participants be-
gan their study session, they received a brief (15-slide) tutorial
presentation that explained the purpose of the nStudy browser
and how to use its tools. This tutorial contained annotated screen-
shots of the nStudy browser and its functionality as well as a test to
ensure they could successfully make a highlight and a note.
7.4. Procedure
The study was introduced to learners during a class visit as an
investigation of the impact of computer-based educational materi-
als on different types of learners by the ﬁrst author. Students were
informed that the experiment involved completion of a reading
task on a topic to be covered in the course; participation in the
study was explained as optional and conﬁdential, requiring less
than one hour, and worth extra credit in their education course.
Once participants indicated their interest, they were given a con-
sent form and a session was scheduled. With the exception of a
written informed consent procedure, all instruments were pre-
sented electronically. During each study session, pre-task ques-
tionnaire measures were completed, then participants viewed the
nStudy tutorial, logged into the nStudy environment, and were gi-
ven the following directions: ‘‘This is the main page for the learn-
ing task you are asked to complete. You have 20 min to study its
contents in any way you wish. When you decide you are ﬁnished
or when time expires, you will complete a posttest and the session
will be over.’’ Participants completed a session and posttest, were
debriefed and dismissed.
7.5. Coding and scoring
The measurement of SRL strategies follows from the assump-
tion of Winne and Perry (2000)that SRL behaviors are best mea-
sured as they occur. Logs of learning behavior were analyzed to

2012 - The effects of achievement goals and self-regulated learning behaviors on reading comprehension in t.pdf,"identify the frequency with which speciﬁc behaviors occurred. A
set of traceable behaviors indicative of cognitive and metacognitive
processes described by SRL theory were conceptualized and cap-
tured within nStudy logs. These behaviors align to SRL theories
of Winne and Hadwin (1998)and Zimmerman (2000, 2011)as well
as to previous methodologies that aim to capture evidence of SRL.
Table 2 contains a list of the traceable behaviors under examina-
tion in this study, as well as the deﬁnition of the action and anal-
ogous codes of traces from prior research. The three coding
methods used as referents are the logged traces fromNesbit and

using Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons’ (1986) Self-Regulated
Learning Interview Schedule.
When a learner completes a learning task in nStudy, the brow-
ser records every action the user completes. These actions include
clicks to access pages, click–and-drags to select text to annotate, or
clicks to utilize features of the environment like the highlighter,
information panel, note tool, and so on. Each recorded action is
stamped with the time it occurred, making it possible to analyze
the sequence of actions and the amount of time between actions,

who interpret log data must choose whether to represent behav-
iors using the number of times an event occurs, the duration of

2012 - The effects of achievement goals and self-regulated learning behaviors on reading comprehension in t.pdf,"to treat a behavior as an occurrence (Winne, 2010) of a behavior, as
a contingency where the action follows a preceding action, or as a
pattern of contingencies. Given the brief duration of the learning
task (20 min) and the limited scope of the task environment, it
was infrequent that a speciﬁc action was consistently preceded
by a different speciﬁc action (generating a contingency). As such,
SRL behaviors were analyzed at the level of occurrences. With
the exception of highlighting, which occurred often, SRL behaviors
were represented as count variables indicating the frequency of
occurrence of a traced behavior across the learning task.
7.6. Data analysis
Replicating the methods employed by other recent studies that
model the self-regulated learning behaviors of a similar sized sam-
ple of learners in a hypermedia learning environment (e.g.n= 170;
Greene, Costa & Denlinger, 2011), we estimated a path model
(Fig. 1) to address the proposed research questions. The model
was composed of ﬁve exogenous variables including three achieve-
ment goal variables and two prior knowledge variables (score on
textbase and situation model subtests). Endogenous variables in-
cluded ﬁve traced SRL behaviors that were anticipated to be pre-
dicted by achievement goals and prior knowledge and predictive
of the two measures of learning.
8. Results and discussion
8.1. Descriptive statistics
On average, participants spent 11 min and 37 s on the task
(SD = 5:11). Of the 160 participants, 94% visited all pages containing
portions of the hypertext and 71% visited the learning objectives
checklist at least once. Forty-four percent followed hyperlinks to
seek out deﬁnitions of key terms. One hundred out of 160 partici-
pants used the highlighter (62.5%) and highlighted 1769 sections
of text while 27 used the note-taking tool (16.8%), making a total
of 78 notes. Thirty-ﬁve of the 100 participants who made annota-
tions reviewed their annotations using the information panel. Oth-
ers may have also reviewed them during their revisitation of
content pages (once text is highlighted, highlights persist). As a
result, it is difﬁcult to accurately assess the exact frequency and
beneﬁt of review of annotations. The mean number of times each
behavior occurred, as well as the skewness and kurtosis of each dis-
tribution appears inTable 3. The skewness and kurtosis statistics
for the behaviors denoted with an asterisk indicate that the distri-
bution of behaviors was non-normal and that a transformation or
different underlying distribution was applied in analyses involving
these data to improve model ﬁt.
8.2. The path model
A matrix of correlations between all variables in the model can be
found inTable 4. To test hypotheses, a path model was estimated
using Mplus 6.11 (Muthén & Muthén, 2010) using a maximum
likelihood estimation method. The ﬁt indices of the model suggest
an acceptable ﬁt to the data,

using negative binomial (reviewing annotations, monitoring under-
standing) and zero-inﬂated Poisson (note-taking) distributions in
order to better represent the distribution of these behaviors (Greene,
Costa, et al., 2011). A histogram of highlighting revealed that 60 indi-
viduals conducted no highlighting, while the remainder of the distri-
bution was relatively normal (skewness = .265). As a result, we
modeled highlighting using an interval scale. Those who did not
use the highlighter were assigned a score of zero, while those who
made between 1 and 22 highlights (within one standard deviation
of 11.056, the mean number of highlights made) were assigned a
one, and those making greater than 22 highlights, a two.

a contingency where the action follows a preceding action, or as a
pattern of contingencies. Given the brief duration of the learning
task (20 min) and the limited scope of the task environment, it
was infrequent that a speciﬁc action was consistently preceded
by a different speciﬁc action (generating a contingency). As such,
SRL behaviors were analyzed at the level of occurrences. With
the exception of highlighting, which occurred often, SRL behaviors
were represented as count variables indicating the frequency of
occurrence of a traced behavior across the learning task.
7.6. Data analysis
Replicating the methods employed by other recent studies that
model the self-regulated learning behaviors of a similar sized sam-
ple of learners in a hypermedia learning environment (e.g.n= 170;
Greene, Costa & Denlinger, 2011), we estimated a path model
(Fig. 1) to address the proposed research questions. The model
was composed of ﬁve exogenous variables including three achieve-
ment goal variables and two prior knowledge variables (score on
textbase and situation model subtests). Endogenous variables in-
cluded ﬁve traced SRL behaviors that were anticipated to be pre-
dicted by achievement goals and prior knowledge and predictive
of the two measures of learning.
8. Results and discussion
8.1. Descriptive statistics
On average, participants spent 11 min and 37 s on the task
(SD = 5:11). Of the 160 participants, 94% visited all pages containing
portions of the hypertext and 71% visited the learning objectives
checklist at least once. Forty-four percent followed hyperlinks to
seek out deﬁnitions of key terms. One hundred out of 160 partici-
pants used the highlighter (62.5%) and highlighted 1769 sections
of text while 27 used the note-taking tool (16.8%), making a total
of 78 notes. Thirty-ﬁve of the 100 participants who made annota-
tions reviewed their annotations using the information panel. Oth-
ers may have also reviewed them during their revisitation of
content pages (once text is highlighted, highlights persist). As a
result, it is difﬁcult to accurately assess the exact frequency and
beneﬁt of review of annotations. The mean number of times each
behavior occurred, as well as the skewness and kurtosis of each dis-
tribution appears inTable 3. The skewness and kurtosis statistics
for the behaviors denoted with an asterisk indicate that the distri-
bution of behaviors was non-normal and that a transformation or
different underlying distribution was applied in analyses involving
these data to improve model ﬁt.
8.2. The path model
A matrix of correlations between all variables in the model can be
found inTable 4. To test hypotheses, a path model was estimated
using Mplus 6.11 (Muthén & Muthén, 2010) using a maximum
likelihood estimation method. The ﬁt indices of the model suggest
an acceptable ﬁt to the data,
The frequency with which learning
behaviors occurred tended to be non-normal and, as a result, were
modeled as counts. In order to improve the ﬁt of our model to this
type of data, a subset of behaviors were re-entered into the model
using negative binomial (reviewing annotations, monitoring under-
standing) and zero-inﬂated Poisson (note-taking) distributions in

use the highlighter were assigned a score of zero, while those who
made between 1 and 22 highlights (within one standard deviation
of 11.056, the mean number of highlights made) were assigned a
one, and those making greater than 22 highlights, a two.
When applied concurrently, these adjustments improved the ﬁt
of the model and yielded the ﬁnal solution that appears inTable 5 and Fig. 3.
Note that the parameter estimates in the model are unstandard-
ized. Standardized coefﬁcients are not available for a model
employing count variables as predictors; when modeled as predic-
tors, these types of variables have no variances (Muthén, 2006;

ter in the model (seeTable 5). In this results section, we summarize
the estimated strength of hypothesized paths from each achieve-
ment goal to SRL behaviors and to comprehension scores, from each
SRL strategy to each comprehension score, and from prior knowl-
edge scores to SRL strategies and comprehension scores.
8.2.1. Achievement goals and comprehension scores
Based on prior research, we hypothesized that performance
avoidance goals should negatively predict comprehension scores
(Senko & Harackiewicz, 2005) and that mastery approach and
performance approach goals were only somewhat likely goals to
have a direct effect on comprehension (Hulleman et al., 2010;
Linnenbrink-Garcia et al., 2008). The ﬁnal model largely supported
these hypotheses. Neither mastery nor performance approach
goals had direct effects on comprehension scores; performance
avoidance did have a negative effect on learning, but only at the
textbase level. While the typical learner was predicted to answer
62% of previously missed items correctly, a 5% decrease was pre-
dicted for each unit increase on the performance avoidance score.
Results for performance avoidance conform to the expectations
of achievement goal theory; those who sought only to avoid a poor
performance in the task were more likely to perform poorly. This
raises a question about the adoption of performance avoidance
goals in individual learning tasks. In a task condition where no nor-
mative reference is available (learners completed the task individ-
ually and no normative reference was provided), a set of learners
continue to report a performance avoidance orientation and expe-
rience the negative effect on learning outcomes that results despite
a lack of opportunity to make peer-referenced comparisons. This
might suggest that a performance avoidance orientation is a stable
individual difference variable attributable to learners that leads to
more pervasive negative learning outcomes across tasks. This con-
trasts with mastery approach and performance approach goals on
achievement which were found to not directly effect achievement
outcomes in this study, but have been found to be associated with
achievement in 40% of studies (Linnenbrink-Garcia et al., 2008).

2012 - The effects of achievement goals and self-regulated learning behaviors on reading comprehension in t.pdf,"8.2.2. Achievement goals and SRL
Based on a combination of theory and prior research using self-
report measures, we hypothesized that higher mastery approach
scores would predict greater amounts of SRL behaviors, higher per-
formance avoidance goals would predict lesser amounts of SRL
behaviors, and that higher performance approach goals would
not predict the learning behaviors we traced with the potential
exception of highlighting (as a shallow processing strategy;Greene
& Miller, 1996; Nesbit et al., 2006). These hypotheses, too, were
partially conﬁrmed by the model. A set of SRL behaviors emerged
based on participants’ achievement goal orientations. Learners
adopting mastery goals tended to take notes, explore the hypertext
using links to seek additional information, and, to a lesser degree,
monitor their progress towards goals by referencing a checklist
of learning objectives. Performance approach scores did not predict
any of these behaviors. Those with high scores on performance
avoidance goals took signiﬁcantly fewer notes and clicked on fewer
links to obtain additional information. No achievement goal pre-
dicted highlighting or review of annotations.
Interpreting these ﬁndings from a multiple goal perspective, we
were unable to model additive or integrative effects of pursuing
multiple goals on any one behavior. As expected, the direction of
effects on behaviors tended to be opposite for mastery approach
goals (positive) and performance avoidance goals (negative). We
also found no signiﬁcant paths from performance approach goals
to strategies, which conﬁrms our hypothesis about performance
goals in a task environment that provided no opportunity for nor-
mative referencing. However, because no signiﬁcant effect of per-
formance approach goals were found on learning behaviors, we
could not examine further how mastery and performance ap-
proach goals might combine or interact to effect learning
behaviors.
On the topic of simultaneous measurement of multiple path-
ways from goals to strategies, we should also offer a note of cau-
tion when interpreting the ﬁndings in this study due to potential
effects of suppression that may arise when simultaneously model-
ing multiple paths to a variable. The inclusion of a third variable
can inﬂuence the relationship between a predictor and a depen-
dent variable (c.f.McKinnon, Krull, & Lockwood, 2000). In instances
where this effect is weakened, the third variable acts as a mediator;
but in instances where the effect is strengthened, the third variable
acts as a suppressor. In this study, SRL behaviors were examined as
mediators between achievement goals and performance. However,
high correlation among achievement goals increases the risk that
including multiple goals in our model might induce a suppression
effect on estimated paths, increasing the size of parameter esti-
mates from achievement goal to learning behaviors in the model.
Comparing the correlations in Table 4 with the parameter esti-
mates in Table 5, estimation of negative paths from performance
approach and performance avoidance goals might reﬂect a sup-
pression effect caused by the high correlation between perfor-
mance approach and performance avoidance goals ( r = .71).
Similar effects may have inﬂuenced paths from mastery approach
to note-taking and from monitoring to situation model learning.
Small increases in parameter estimates can turn non-signiﬁcant
or marginal effects into signiﬁcant ones, which changes the
appearance and interpretation of path models. We think that this
behavioral approach has potential for ﬁner-grained analysis of ef-
fects of achievement goals on students’ use of strategies and their
effect on learning, but these initial ﬁndings should be interpreted
with caution until they can be replicated in additional studies.
Assuming for now that the ﬁndings are robust, results in this
study differ from earlier work that examined how achievement
goals inﬂuence cognitive engagement strategies. In studies that
treated strategy use as a unitary variable self-reported by learners,
adoption of mastery goals predicted higher levels of cognitive
engagement, and those that separated out strategies into shallow
or deep cognitive and metacognitive strategies found that mastery
goals promoted deep cognitive and metacognitive strategies, while
performance approach goals promoted shallow cognitive strate-
gies. When we assessed strategies using behavioral traces instead
of self-report, mastery goals predicted only a subset of the behav-
iors we traced, and performance approach goals did not predict any
behaviors. Mastery goals did predicted two strategies one might
conceive of as reﬂecting cognitive processes like elaboration and
organization (note-taking, information-seeking) and were a mar-
ginal predictor of a behavior reﬂecting metacognitive monitoring.
8.2.3. SRL and situation model comprehension
The third dimension of our research question focused on the
relations between self-regulated learning behaviors and textbase
and situation model comprehension. As can be seen in the model,
learning behaviors did not affect textbase comprehension. How-
ever, participants’ tendency to highlight and to monitor their pro-
gress towards learning goals both predicted increases in the
amount comprehension would increase on the situation model
subtest. These ﬁndings align closely to self-regulated learning the-
ory, which suggests that a task must be sufﬁciently difﬁcult for a
self-regulated learning behavior to be relevant to successful perfor-
mance (Greene & Azevedo, 2009). Given that the typical partici-
pant in the study learned 80% of the available material regardless
of their SRL behaviors, acquiring textbase comprehension was
not a sufﬁciently difﬁcult task to require SRL to ensure success.
At the situation model level, however, the typical learner improved
comprehension only 46%. This subtest was considerably more dif-
ﬁcult and results indicate that learners who conducted speciﬁc SRL
behaviors learned more than their peers. Identiﬁcation of impor-
tant segments of text (as evidenced by increased rates of highlight-
ing) predicted increases in comprehension. Similarly, evaluation of
progress towards learning goals, as evidenced by repeated visita-
tion to a learning goals checklist, may have supported inference
generation, a key to the development of situation model compre-
hension, according to Construction-Integration Theory (Kintsch,
1998).
8.2.4. Prior knowledge, SRL and learning outcomes
Our model also accounted for the effect of prior knowledge on
strategy use and learning. Our hypothesis that prior knowledge
would predict increased monitoring, decreased strategy use and
increases in learning was partially conﬁrmed. Pretest situation
model comprehension scores predicted monitoring scores (repli-
cating Moos & Azevedo, 2008), however no effect was found on
any of the other behaviors we examined. Higher pretest textbase
comprehension scores predicted larger increases in both textbase
and situation model comprehension, suggesting that increased
amounts of prior knowledge made it easier to acquire new knowl-
edge within the task. Higher pretest situation model scores pre-
dicted lower amounts of learning. This was due to the inclusion
of some less difﬁcult items and a particularly difﬁcult item. Those
with high prior knowledge correctly answered the easier items at
pretest and their learning score reﬂects difﬁculty mastering the
additional challenging item. Situation model learning scores of
those with lower prior knowledge indicate their mastery of easier
items in addition to their mastery of the more difﬁcult item. Hav-
ing examined each component of the model, we now consider the
results of the study at a higher level, compare the ﬁndings to prior
research, and discuss implications of the ﬁndings.

mates in Table 5, estimation of negative paths from performance
approach and performance avoidance goals might reﬂect a sup-
pression effect caused by the high correlation between perfor-
mance approach and performance avoidance goals ( r = .71).
Similar effects may have inﬂuenced paths from mastery approach

8.3. Implications
A primary purpose of this study was to use behavioral data to
reexamine the previous ﬁnding that learners’ achievement goals"
2012 - The effects of achievement goals and self-regulated learning behaviors on reading comprehension in t.pdf,"predict the cognitive strategies they use, which in turn predict
their performance on learning tasks. In addition to producing a
model based on behavioral assessments of strategy use, this study
prompts discussion of some next steps towards reconciling behav-
ioral measures with the cognitive, metacognitive and self-regula-
tory processes that they and self-report measures are intended to
reﬂect.
The ﬁnal model we estimated revealed that mastery goals pre-
dicted two (note-taking, seeking additional information) of the ﬁve
self-regulated learning behaviors we traced, and a third path from
mastery to monitoring was marginally signiﬁcant. Of these pre-
dicted behaviors, only monitoring was a signiﬁcant predictor of in-
creases in comprehension, and only at the situation model level. If
we compare this model to prior research using self-reported strat-
egy use to investigate the same relationships, we ﬁnd that a gener-
alized pathway from mastery goals to cognitive strategy use to
learning is maintained. However, direct observation of learners’
behavior demonstrates that cognitive engagement is not evenly
distributed across the set of strategies typically characterized as
deep cognitive strategies in the literature. Instead one’s mastery
goals predict the use of a subset of cognitive strategies, only one
of which is predictive of learning.
Of the behaviors we measured, highlighting had a signiﬁcant
and stronger effect on learning than all but one of the strategies
associated with self-regulated learning and cognitive engagement
that we traced (monitoring). Highlighting has been alternately
conceived of as a shallow cognitive strategy (Nesbit et al., 2006),
and as a type of behavior that may lead to deeper cognitive engage-
ment (Greene et al., 2004). Highlighting was predictive of note-tak-
ing and of review of annotations. Based on these ﬁndings, we can
partially conﬁrm Greene and colleagues’ hypothesis. What we can-
not say is what type of cognitive processes occurred as learners
highlighted text. Were they simply conducting rehearsal, akin to
the shallow strategies reported in prior studies? Did highlighting
reﬂect a metacognitive judgment that speciﬁc passages were
important? Was the highlighter a tool used to select passages for
further elaboration or a method of identifying passages to be orga-
nized with prior knowledge or other important segments of the
text?
These unanswered questions reﬂect the current challenge asso-
ciated with the use of behavioral evidence of learning processes.
Using behavioral traces eliminates biases associated with self-re-
ports and can help researchers avoid potential mischaracteriza-
tions of strategies as reﬂecting a particular type of cognitive
process that may not have occurred. However, the cognitive pro-
cesses that are occurring while the behavior is being logged are
not known. In the case of highlighting, further investigation, per-
haps using eye tracking and think-aloud protocols, might be in or-
der to investigate how learners attend to text when highlighting
and what mental processes occur as they do so.
For now, we have identiﬁed a behavior (highlighting) that pro-
moted learning. Interestingly, we found that highlighting predicted
situation model comprehension increases but not textbase in-
creases. One would expect a strategy described as shallow to pre-
dict textbase learning and not the deeper learning reﬂected by
situation model learning scores. However, since the opposite was
true we must consider that the act of highlighting may reﬂect a
deeper consideration of the text than previously thought.
8.4. Limitations
The limitations unique to this study include the validity of log
data, the comprehensiveness of the behaviors traced, and the task
context in which the study was conducted. While the use of behav-
ioral logs eliminates bias and inaccuracy associated with self-re-
port measures, log analyses are not without limitation
themselves. Using log data to represent SRL variables introduces
a new limitation in that indicators have yet to be validated to
learners’ self-reported cognitive processes that traces are intended
to represent. Conclusions can be drawn only about a speciﬁc
behavior as a predictor of learning, and connection made to cogni-
tive or metacognitive operations are tentative until a trace can be
validated. As suggested byGreene and Azevedo (2009), future re-
search needs to be conducted to pair think-aloud data with log
analyses in order to assess the validity of inferences regarding
the cognitive processes behavioral traces reﬂect.
In addition to requiring validation to ensure that the behaviors
we observed reﬂected the strategies learners intended to employ,
our list of traceable behaviors (n = 5) is short in comparison to
number of constructs assessed by self-report measures of cognitive
engagement or by think aloud codes of SRL processes (n > 30).
Increasing the amount and type of information in a log ﬁle and
the sophistication with which we interpret it can yield an ex-
panded list of traceable behaviors. These can better approximate
the type and frequency of cognitive strategies learners employ.
Environments with features that capture these self-regulated
learning behaviors are emerging (e.g. MetaTutor;Azevedo, Wither-
spoon, Chauncey, Burkett, & Fike, 2009), as are more complex
interpretations of log data (Aleven, Roll, McLaren, & Koedinger,
2010). It is possible that, were we able to trace additional behaviors
that are self-reported in other studies, these behaviors might have
been associated with mastery goals and learning outcomes as
found in prior research. Being able to trace any learning behaviors
is a step up from asking students to recount them, but our methods
and predictive models will need to improve so we can increase the
number of strategies we can capture and model.
Learning environments differ in their affordances and restric-
tions as well as the content of the task and the type of performance
used to assess learning. As a result, all ﬁndings need to be consid-
ered in light of a task context. Our task involved learning from
hypertext in a web-based environment stocked with tools meant
to support speciﬁc learning behaviors. Other environments may
support different behaviors and each set of tools and traced behav-
iors may predict different outcomes depending upon the content of
the task and the way learning is assessed. Researchers should con-
sider this when interpreting ﬁndings, and any generalization of
these ﬁndings to new contexts should be limited to instances
where populations and environments are similar.
One ﬁnal limitation to our study that bears mentioning con-
cerns subjects’ interpretation of the items used to assess their
achievement goals. We used the original wording of the AGQ-R
items, which refer to one’s goals for ‘‘this class.’’ We did so because
we chose a topic that would be discussed later in the class and told
students to treat the task as they would any other course reading.
Subjects were reminded of this upon recruitment and at the begin-
ning of the session. However, because sessions were conducted
separate from class instruction, subjects may not have interpreted
the reading task as afﬁliated with readings to be done for their
course, which might have inﬂuenced the achievement goals they
reported.
8.5. Summary and conclusions
Speciﬁc achievement goals motivated individual self-regulated
learning behaviors, and some of these behaviors affected compre-
hension of a hypertext reading. Mastery learners were more apt
to take notes and seek information and marginally more likely to
monitor learning. Monitoring predicted higher levels of compre-
hension at the situation model level. This conﬁrmed prior evidence
that mastery goals were the most beneﬁcial achievement orienta-
tion for motivating enactment of learning strategies that lead to
learning, however not all of the strategies that mastery goals
M.L. Bernacki et al. / Contemporary Educational Psychology 37 (2012) 148–161 159","predict the cognitive strategies they use, which in turn predict
their performance on learning tasks. In addition to producing a
model based on behavioral assessments of strategy use, this study
prompts discussion of some next steps towards reconciling behav-
ioral measures with the cognitive, metacognitive and self-regula-
tory processes that they and self-report measures are intended to
reﬂect.
The ﬁnal model we estimated revealed that mastery goals pre-
dicted two (note-taking, seeking additional information) of the ﬁve
self-regulated learning behaviors we traced, and a third path from
mastery to monitoring was marginally signiﬁcant. Of these pre-
dicted behaviors, only monitoring was a signiﬁcant predictor of in-
creases in comprehension, and only at the situation model level. If
we compare this model to prior research using self-reported strat-
egy use to investigate the same relationships, we ﬁnd that a gener-
alized pathway from mastery goals to cognitive strategy use to
learning is maintained. However, direct observation of learners’
behavior demonstrates that cognitive engagement is not evenly
distributed across the set of strategies typically characterized as
deep cognitive strategies in the literature. Instead one’s mastery
goals predict the use of a subset of cognitive strategies, only one
of which is predictive of learning.
Of the behaviors we measured, highlighting had a signiﬁcant
and stronger effect on learning than all but one of the strategies
associated with self-regulated learning and cognitive engagement
that we traced (monitoring). Highlighting has been alternately
conceived of as a shallow cognitive strategy,
and as a type of behavior that may lead to deeper cognitive engage-
ment. Highlighting was predictive of note-tak-
ing and of review of annotations. Based on these ﬁndings, we can
partially conﬁrm Greene and colleagues’ hypothesis. What we can-
not say is what type of cognitive processes occurred as learners
highlighted text. Were they simply conducting rehearsal, akin to

sures of learning we administered. Additionally, other strategies
not motivated by mastery goals (highlighting) were signiﬁcant pre-
dictors of increased comprehension. In addition to fostering mas-
tery goals to promote deep strategy use, it would be beneﬁcial to
teach learners to consider the task conditions and the utility of dif-
ferent learning strategies that are supported by the learning envi-
ronment. If students’ mastery goals compel them to take notes,
seek additional information and monitor their learning process,
they might also be taught to monitor their environment and adapt
their strategies in light of the context. Monitoring both one’s learn-
ing process and the learning environment would increase the like-
lihood that students would attend to task conditions and select
optimal strategies for the task and achieve the greatest level of
comprehension as a result.
8.6. Future directions
Moving forward, it is important to continue to develop the
methods by which we capture evidence of learning behaviors so
that we might better approximate the cognitive and metacognitive
processes that constitute self-regulated learning. Behavioral data is
more robust against the bias and error associated with self-report
data. If we can develop behavioral traces that reﬂect SRL strategies,
our models of the learning process will support better investiga-
tions into the links between motivational constructs, learning
behaviors and learning outcomes. It will be important to examine
these relationships in additional learning environments, both in
traditional classrooms where trace data can be collected and in
multiple technology-enhanced learning environments where dif-
ferent task conditions (e.g. tool provision, task structure, domain,
measures of learning) are present. Further investigation will allow
us to determine the degree to which relations between achieve-
ment goals, learning behaviors and learning outcomes are robust
across contexts or are dependent on features of a learning task.
