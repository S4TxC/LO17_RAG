In the United States, pervasive achievement inequity exists 
for various racial groups. Teacher preparation programs 
(TPPs) can play an important role in preparing novice teach-
ers to curtail existing achievement disparities, but little is 
known about how student outcomes differ by race across 
TPPs. TPPs often adopt various models, which include 
diversity courses and field experiences that are designed to 
develop dispositions for effective teaching in racially diverse 
contexts. However, much is to be learned about relationships 
between TPPs, teacher beliefs and dispositions, and student 
outcomes by race.
In this study, I summarize the large-scale literature on the 
relationships between TPPs, teacher dispositions, and student 
outcomes. I also identify some gaps in the literature and address 
these gaps using Boykin and Noguera’s (2011) research-based 
scheme for promoting enhanced classroom teaching and learn-
ing to examine relationships between certification status, 
teacher beliefs and dispositions, and achievement disparities in 
mathematics for underrepresented racial groups
1. I conclude by 
offering some recommendations for improving TPP capacity to 
address racial achievement differences.
Review of Literature
There is often great debate about the best pathways for pro-
spective teachers to enter the profession. Despite vigorous 
debate about teacher pathways, Sleeter (2014) contends that 
due to the small amounts of available evidence, advocacy is 
often based on ideology. In a review of 196 studies from four 
top teacher education journals, Sleeter (2014) found that 
only 6% of the articles in 2012 examined the effects of 
teacher education on teaching practice or student outcomes. 
Although there are some limitations in the scope of current 
research, several large-scale studies have examined relation-
ships between TPPs and student outcomes.
Certification Status and Student Outcomes
In a study that compared 20 university-based TPPs in 
Washington (state) to out-of-state certified teachers, research-
ers found small, but meaningful standard test score differ -
ences across TPPs (Goldhaber, Liddle, & Theobold, 2013). 
The authors found that differences in mathematics achieve-
ment between the least and most effective TPPs can be larger 
than expected differences between students who are eligible 
for free and reduced lunch and those who are not. In addition,

A National Study of the Differential 
Impact of Novice Teacher Certification 
on Teacher Traits and Race-Based 
Mathematics Achievement
Kenneth Alonzo Anderson1
Abstract
In this study, differential prediction of student outcomes by race and teacher traits relative to the certification levels of novice 
teachers was assessed. Overall, algebra achievement was higher for students who were taught by teachers with standard 
certificates relative to students who were taught by novice teachers with nonstandard certificates. The most conservative 
estimates show that findings are equivalent to approximately 8 months of additional instruction for students who were taught 
by teachers with standard certificates. However, the benefits of being taught by a teacher with standard certification did 
not translate to underrepresented racial groups. Overall, there were several differences in dispositions across certification 
conditions. With respect to underrepresented racial groups, only one disposition was significantly different across conditions. 
Teachers with nonstandard certificates reported higher emphasis on increasing mathematics interests. For underrepresented 
racial groups, relationships between both certification conditions and achievement were underwhelming. Recommendations 
to improve teacher effectiveness are provided.

In a study that compared 20 university-based TPPs in 
Washington (state) to out-of-state certified teachers, research-
ers found small, but meaningful standard test score differ -
ences across TPPs (Goldhaber, Liddle, & Theobold, 2013). 
The authors found that differences in mathematics achieve-

than expected differences between students who are eligible 
for free and reduced lunch and those who are not. In addition,"
2019 - A National Study of the Differential Impact of Novice Teacher Certification on Teacher Traits and Ra.pdf,"248 Journal of Teacher Education 71(2)
the authors found that differences in reading achievement 
between the least and most effective TPPs can be larger than 
expected differences between students with learning disabili-
ties relative to students without learning disabilities. 
Washington is not a state with large amounts of teachers who 
enter the profession through alternative pathways, so the 
authors excluded uncertified teachers in the analysis. As a 
preface to the results, the authors provided a cautionary note 
indicating that student subgroups, such as race and gender, 
accounted for meaningful achievement differences as well. 
These factors were accounted for in the models, but were not 
discussed further.
Other studies have investigated the relationships between 
TPPs and student achievement as well. In a series of studies 
using data from North Carolina, researchers found that 
teacher credentials are associated with higher student 
achievement, but also found that teacher credentials are ineq-
uitably distributed across schools (Clotfelter, Ladd, & 
Vigdor, 2006, 2010; Clotfelter, Ladd, Vigdor, & Wheeler, 
2010). Findings showed that students in high poverty schools 
were consistently likely to be taught by teachers who earned 
lower scores on certification exams, did not have a regular 
license, or had not earned National Board Certification. 
Likewise, in a study of New York teachers, researchers found 
that initial mathematics and English language arts student 
achievement gains were smaller for teachers who completed 
reduced coursework relative to teachers who completed a 
university-based teacher education program (Boyd, 
Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, & Wyckoff, 2006). Similar to 
Goldhaber et al.’s (2013) study, the authors account for sub-
group differences in their models, but did not analyze rela-
tionships between TPPs and subgroups.
Beyond state-level studies, researchers have used nation-
ally representative samples to show that teacher certification 
is positively correlated with higher achievement. Using data 
from more than 2,70,000 students and 10,000 schools, 
Lubienski, Lubienski, and Crane (2008) examined differ -
ences between public and private schools across five 
domains: school size, class size, school climate/parental 
involvement, teacher certification, and instructional prac-
tices. The authors analyzed the data using a series of 12 pro-
gressive multilevel models. One of the models examined 
four teacher background variables: certification status, 
major, first year or not, and the number of professional devel-
opment activities completed. Of the teacher variables, only 
the certified teacher indicator, was positively and signifi-
cantly related to student achievement in fourth and eighth 
grades. The authors also concluded that race and socioeco-
nomic factors were the strongest predictors of achievement, 
but did not offer commentary or analysis relative to the rela-
tionships between teacher certification and demographics.
Positive relationships between teacher certification and 
student achievement have also been documented in interna-
tional contexts outside of the United States as well. In a study 
of more than 5,80,000 students in Swedish compulsory 
schools, authors found that when the share of noncertified 
teachers increases by 1%, standardized grade point averages 
of students decrease by 1.8 standard deviations (Andersson, 
Johansson, & Waldenstrom, 2011). The authors concluded 
that these differences were large enough to alleviate gender 
differences in achievement as well as disadvantages that may 
be associated with immigrant status.
Contrary to findings noted above, some studies have 
found no differences in achievement across certification 
pathways. In a study of approximately 2,600 students across 
63 schools in the United States over 2 years, researchers 
found no differences in mathematics and reading achieve-
ment between students taught by alternatively certified ver -
sus traditionally certified teachers (Constantine et al., 2009). 
Likewise, in a study of Arabian countries in the Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC), researchers did not find consis-
tent relationships between certification status and test scores 
reported on the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study 
(Wiseman & Al-baker, 2013). The authors indicated that 
many GCC TPPs were not rigorously evaluated on a consis-
tent basis, making it challenging to evaluate their effects. 
Some other factors that were associated with higher achieve-
ment in the GCC study included teacher interactions and 
their abilities to motivate and teach students. Similarly, 
Constantine et al. also acknowledged that individual teachers 
have differential effects on student outcomes, but were not 
able to identify the traits of the teacher that were associated 
with different levels of student achievement.
Teacher Dispositions and Student Outcomes
In the previous section, I cited research that documented 
relationships between TPPs and student achievement. 
However, more research on teacher-specific characteristics 
that improve achievement for underrepresented racial groups 
is necessary. One class of teacher traits to consider is that of 
dispositions. Dispositions can be defined as
attributed characteristics of a teacher that represent a trend of a 
teacher’s judgments and actions in ill-structured contexts 
(situations in which there is more than one way to solve a 
dilemma; even experts disagree on which way is best). Further, 
it is assumed that these dispositions, trends in teacher judgments 
and actions, develop over time when teachers participate in 
deliberate professional education programs . . . (Reiman & 
Johnson, 2007, p. 677)
In some of my prior work, I demonstrate value in assess-
ing relationships between self-reported teacher dispositions 
and student outcomes. Using principal components analysis 
and regression analysis of national survey data, I found that 
when comparing high-achieving Black students to all other 
high-achieving students, self-reported teacher beliefs were 
significantly related to mathematics scores of high-achieving 
non-Black students. Yet, teacher beliefs were not signifi-
cantly related to mathematics achievement of high-achieving","the authors found that differences in reading achievement 
between the least and most effective TPPs can be larger than 
expected differences between students with learning disabili-
ties relative to students without learning disabilities.

Black students, although teachers reported higher beliefs 
about high-achieving Black students. Teachers of non-Black 
high-achieving students also reported higher levels of math-
ematics content training than those of high-achieving Black 
students (K. A. Anderson, 2014). These findings highlighted 
potential differential prediction of race-based teacher dispo-
sitions for high-achieving students.
Research has also shown that structural features of tradi-
tional TPPs, such as well-designed student teaching practica, 
are related to teacher effectiveness, dispositions, and teacher 
efficacy (D’alessio, 2018; Ronfeldt, 2012, 2015; Ronfeldt & 
Reininger, 2012). Qualitative studies have shown that the 
assessment of teacher dispositions is an essential factor for 
enhancing outcomes for underrepresented racial groups 
(Hill-Jackson & Lewis, 2010; Hollins, 2011). TPPs often 
offer courses and practicum experiences to build competence 
with racially diverse populations. However, teacher candi-
dates, regardless of pathway, often resist discussions and 
program requirements that focus on race. Resistance is often 
related to individuals fearing that race discussions may lead 
to conflicts with colleagues, unfair judgment, and labeling 
for sharing honest opinions or experiences, or that the United 
States is reaching a postracial era (Milner, 2015). Milner and 
Laughter (2015) found that teachers have little confidence in 
their abilities to discuss race and are less willing to talk about 
race relative to their own teaching practices and identities. 
Using critical race theory, they found that teachers generally 
exhibited five common mind-sets. Specifically, teachers 
believe the following:
1. Acknowledging one’s own racial background or the 
background of one’s students may lead to racist 
labeling.
2. Treating all students the same regardless of their 
racial or ethnic backgrounds is appropriate.
3. Teaching children and ignoring the race of students is 
the right course of action because race is irrelevant.
4. Focusing on race while teaching does not matter 
because racism has ended.
5. Promoting postracial practices are appropriate because 
we live in a postracial society.
In a different study of preservice teacher dispositions, Hill-
Jackson and Lewis (2010) found that dispositions of White 
preservice teachers, the dominant group of preservice 
teachers, could be categorized into two categories regard-
ing multicultural education, advocates and resisters. 
Furthermore, they described five dispositions associated 
with advocates and resisters. Advocates may exhibit high 
cognitive complexity, a multifocal worldview, empathy, 
ethical traits, and high self-efficacy. Resisters may exhibit 
low cognitive complexity, a unifocal worldview, apathy, 
immoral traits, and low self-efficacy. The findings noted in 
this section led to recommendations for reformation of tra-
ditional and nontraditional TPPs to enhance dispositions 
about race and culture (Hill-Jackson & Lewis, 2010; Milner 
& Laughter, 2015).
Improving Achievement Outcomes for 
Underrepresented Racial Groups
Boykin and Noguera (2011) published a framework, the 
research-based scheme for promoting enhanced classroom 
teaching and learning, in their text, Creating the Opportunity 
to Learn. This framework is well-suited to address some of 
the critiques and findings noted in the previous sections. 
Their work, which is a compilation of works, emphasizes the 
importance of creating opportunities to learn (OTL) by sum-
marizing primary and secondary research that is predictive of 
improving achievement for Black and Hispanic/Latino stu-
dents. Boykin and Noguera’s research-based scheme identi-
fies three key domains: student engagement, classroom-based 
asset-focused factors, and guiding functions.
Boykin and Noguera (2011) indicated that student engage-
ment includes cognitive, affective, and behavioral engage-
ment. Cognitive engagement focuses on mental processes for 
comprehending complex concepts and acquiring difficult 
skills. Affective engagement describes emotional reactions 
to tasks, and behavioral engagement refers to general on-task 
behaviors. The authors cite several studies that documented 
the predictive relationships of engagement to student 
achievement. One notable study, using national early child-
hood data, demonstrated that engagement had higher effects 
on math gains than did instructional time (DiPerna, Lei, & 
Reid, 2007).
Asset-focused factors describe the “contextual conditions 
in which teaching, learning, engagement, and guiding func-
tions manifest,” (Boykin & Noguera, 2011, p. 69). Specific 
examples of asset-focused factors include interpersonal rela-
tionships between teachers and students, teachers’ ability to 
personalize and use cultural resources in teaching situations, 
and teachers’ ability to scaffold and support information pro-
cessing. In their text, the authors describe an asset-focused 
factor, known as intersubjectivity, by focusing on two key 
components: meaningful learning and cultural concerns. 
Intersubjectivity “speaks to how well the values, interests, 
and learning priorities of the teacher are aligned with those 
of the students and the extent to which these aligned empha-
ses are reflected in the curriculum,” (p. 91).
The authors provide examples of how cultural mismatch 
in the classroom, initiated by teachers, may affect student–
teacher relationships. For example, the authors describe the 
communal learning preferences of many Black students. 
Based on several hundred hours of classroom observation, 
the authors found that individual and competitive classroom 
learning situations was most commonly observed and initi-
ated by the teacher (Boykin, Tyler, & Miller, 2005). They 
also found that when communal learning was evident, it was 
almost always initiated by Black students, not the teacher, 
and was associated with negative teacher feedback. When","Black students, although teachers reported higher beliefs 
about high-achieving Black students. Teachers of non-Black 
high-achieving students also reported higher levels of math-
ematics content training than those of high-achieving Black 
students (K. A. Anderson, 2014). These findings highlighted 
potential differential prediction of race-based teacher dispo-
sitions for high-achieving students.
Research has also shown that structural features of tradi-
tional TPPs, such as well-designed student teaching practica, 
are related to teacher effectiveness, dispositions, and teacher

Improving Achievement Outcomes for 
Underrepresented Racial Groups
Boykin and Noguera (2011) published a framework, the 
research-based scheme for promoting enhanced classroom 
teaching and learning, in their text, Creating the Opportunity 
to Learn. This framework is well-suited to address some of 
the critiques and findings noted in the previous sections. 
Their work, which is a compilation of works, emphasizes the 
importance of creating opportunities to learn (OTL) by sum-
marizing primary and secondary research that is predictive of

dents. Boykin and Noguera’s research-based scheme identi-

describing their framework, the authors also cited several 
randomized experiments that demonstrated how culture 
affects achievement (Boykin, Lilja, & Tyler, 2004; Hurley, 
Boykin, & Allen, 2005; Hurley, Allen, & Boykin, 2009). In 
one of these examples, the authors assigned students to one 
of the three randomized conditions, interpersonal conditions 
with contingent rewards, group competition with contingent 
rewards, and communal conditions with no rewards. They 
found that Black students performed significantly better than 
White students on math estimation tasks under the commu-
nal condition without rewards and White students performed 
significantly better than Black students on mathematics esti-
mation tasks under the interpersonal competition condition 
with rewards (see Hurley, Allen, & Boykin, 2009).
Another key factor noted in Boykin and Noguera’s (2011) 
framework is that of guiding functions. Guiding functions 
include a cluster of factors that “can steer, shape, govern, and 
intensify fundamental engagement processes,” (p. 51). 
Examples of guiding functions include self-efficacy, self-
regulated learning, beliefs about ability, and persistence. The 
authors cite several examples of guiding functions and how 
they may manifest in the classroom. One example describes 
the dichotomies of fixed versus malleable beliefs about one’s 
own ability. Describing a different randomized experiment 
of Black and Latino seventh graders, the authors show how 
beliefs about ability can affect how students respond in times 
of failure. They summarize work that contends that students 
with a fixed belief may be less likely to persist in the face of 
failure or may be more occupied with maintaining self-
respect. Contrarily, students who maintain malleable beliefs 
about learning are more likely to try to learn from 
 high-achieving students, are more task persistent, and are 
less anxious about novel learning experiences (see Blackwell, 
Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007).
Strengths of Boykin and Noguera’s (2011) framework are 
that many of the factors in the research-based scheme for 
promoting enhanced classroom teaching and learning have 
direct implications for teacher certification programs and are 
closely linked to teacher dispositions and efficacy. In their 
text, Boykin and Noguera reinforce several key components 
that are essential to OTL. Specifically, the authors close by 
describing the need to overdetermine the success of under -
represented groups. They provide recommendations for 
teachers to develop dispositions and practices that maximize 
daily learning opportunities. Some of these dispositions and 
practices include paying attention to classroom transactions 
and dynamics, focusing on student assets, educating the 
whole child, and providing multiple pathways to success. 
Moreover, the authors advocate for teacher development 
opportunities that ensue over time, provide constructive 
feedback, and include job-embedded support.
Many of the components of the research-based scheme 
for promoting enhanced classroom teaching and learning are 
consistent with overarching goals of many TPPs. In fact, at 
least one known teacher certification program has imple-
mented components of Boykin and Noguera’s framework 
into their model. However, most of the evidence for the effi-
cacy of Boykin and Noguera’s framework has been docu-
mented using research on inservice teachers. No known 
large-scale studies investigate links between preservice 
teacher training and student outcomes, after their first years 
of teaching, based on components of Boykin and Noguera’s 
framework. Given that Boykin and Noguera’s framework 
represent a compilation of works, many of the components, 
include teacher dispositions and efficacy goals that are com-
mon to many TPPs. Some of these components include 
increasing mathematics interests, making content connec-
tions to business and industry, engaging students, developing 
problem-solving skills of students, and embedding historical 
and cultural relevance.
Additional Opportunities for Large-Scale Teacher 
Preparation Research
Large-scale research that assesses interactions between TPPs, 
teacher dispositions, and student outcomes by race is limited. 
Teacher and student voice, through self-report, is an underuti-
lized and low-cost approach to assessing teacher dispositions 
and assessing relationships to student achievement, thereby 
highlighting opportunities for additional large-scale teacher 
preparation research. Researchers have found that simply 
asking students questions can provide valuable insight and 
reduce bias in estimates in educational settings. When analyz-
ing results from random and nonrandom assignment of psy-
chology students to a mathematics versus vocabulary training 
condition, researchers found that topical preference was a 
superior and necessary domain for reducing bias, especially 
relative to mathematics outcomes (Steiner, Cook, Shadish, & 
Clark, 2010). In addition, the authors found that the combina-
tion of demographics, proxy pretests, and prior academic 
achievement performed similarly in predicting student 
choices for selecting training conditions, but were not neces-
sarily superior to simply asking students which topic they 
preferred. Given the value of teacher-reported dispositions 
and efficacy and the low-cost of survey administration, con-
necting teacher-reported dispositions to administrative data 
and student outcomes provide an opportunity to explore the 
prevalence of Boykin and Noguera’s framework across TPPs. 
Specifically, comparisons across certification condition and 
race-based subgroups would provide direction for future 
research on enhancing outcomes for underrepresented groups. 
Accordingly, this study addresses this gap.
Much of the existing large-scale TPP research makes 
common assumptions or uses common methodological 
approaches, especially as it relates to race-based outcomes. 
Yet, more than 20 years ago, Cochran-Smith (1995) called 
on teachers and teacher educators to re-consider assump-
tions that are made about race and other groups in schools. 
Many large-scale researchers have advocated for models 
that use statistical controls that essentially eliminate rela-
tionships between student demographics and student growth 
(Ehlert, Koedel, Parsons, & Podgursky, 2014). The idea is to","describing their framework, the authors also cited several 
randomized experiments that demonstrated how culture 
affects achievement. In 
one of these examples, the authors assigned students to one 
of the three randomized conditions, interpersonal conditions 
with contingent rewards, group competition with contingent 
rewards, and communal conditions with no rewards. They 
found that Black students performed significantly better than 
White students on math estimation tasks under the commu-
nal condition without rewards and White students performed 
significantly better than Black students on mathematics esti-
mation tasks under the interpersonal competition condition 
with rewards (see Hurley, Allen, & Boykin, 2009).
Another key factor noted in Boykin and Noguera’s (2011) 
framework is that of guiding functions. Guiding functions 
include a cluster of factors that “can steer, shape, govern, and 
intensify fundamental engagement processes,” (p. 51). 
Examples of guiding functions include self-efficacy, self-
regulated learning, beliefs about ability, and persistence. The 
authors cite several examples of guiding functions and how 
they may manifest in the classroom. One example describes 
the dichotomies of fixed versus malleable beliefs about one’s 
own ability. Describing a different randomized experiment 
of Black and Latino seventh graders, the authors show how 
beliefs about ability can affect how students respond in times 
of failure. They summarize work that contends that students 
with a fixed belief may be less likely to persist in the face of 
failure or may be more occupied with maintaining self-
respect. Contrarily, students who maintain malleable beliefs 
about learning are more likely to try to learn from 
 high-achieving students, are more task persistent, and are 
less anxious about novel learning experiences (see Blackwell,

use statistical controls to “level the playing field” to draw 
conclusions about effectiveness, regardless of student demo-
graphics. Statistical controls are often operationalized using 
variables such as percentages of racial groups in given 
samples.
Statistical controls often enhance estimation, but rarely 
lead to specific recommendations, nuanced insight, or emer-
gent better practices for racial/ethnic groups. Instead conclu-
sions are often described in terms of average or overall 
student effects. Moreover, researchers have asserted that 
simply using race/ethnicity as control variables implies 
inherent low expectations (K. A. Anderson, 2015, 2016; 
Brown, 2011; Timmermans, Doolard, & de Wolf, 2011). In 
some cases, data limitations may prevent researchers from 
disentangling outcomes by race. Thus, I am not wholly advo-
cating for the abandonment of the use of statistical controls 
for demographics, but I am advocating for an expansion of 
methodological approaches used in large-scale TPP research 
to initiate policy and practice that is accountable for demo-
graphics, especially race.
Another common practice in large-scale TPP research is to 
assume that relationships between TPPs and student out-
comes are linear. A challenge with assuming linearity is that 
such models may be misspecified in practice (Lin, Li, & Sun, 
2014), possibly leading to biased effect estimates. However, 
additional approaches that relax parametric assumptions, 
such as the use of propensity score methods, (Price, Spriggs, 
& Swinton, 2011) may be useful in exploring large-scale TPP 
research. Accordingly, this study appeals to Raudenbush’s 
(2015) appeal for “a wide range of related research and a 
coherent theory of action” (p. 141) by providing a fresh 
approach to large-scale TPP research. Specifically, I investi-
gate outcomes using a range of methodologies and statistical 
assumptions, allowing readers to make informed judgments 
and assess consistency of results about TPPs and race-based 
outcomes across conditions.
The literature review and limitations of existing large-
scale TPPs were used to guide this study. Moreover, compo-
nents of Boykin and Noguera’s (2011) framework were used 
to assist in selecting variables and examining relationships 
across certification conditions. As the goal of the study is to 
examine relationships between teacher certification, teacher 
traits, and student achievement, with a specific interest in 
examining differential prediction for underrepresented racial 
groups, the following research questions were developed.
Research Question 1: What are the differences in math-
ematics outcomes for students who were taught by novice 
teachers who held standard certificates compared with 
students who were taught by novice teachers who held 
nonstandard certificates?
Research Question 2: Does certification status of novice 
teachers differentially predict mathematics outcomes for 
underrepresented racial groups versus represented racial 
groups?
Research Question 3: What are the differences in 
teacher-reported instructional practices and beliefs for 
novice teachers who held standard certificates compared 
with novice teachers who held nonstandard certificates.

teachers differentially predict teacher-reported instruc-
tional practices and beliefs for underrepresented racial 
groups versus represented racial groups?
Method
Sample
Data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 
(HSLS:09; Ingels, Dalton, Holder, Lauff, & Burns, 2011) 
were used in this study. The HSLS:09 research team col-
lected data from a nationally representative sample of high 
school students to assess high school, postsecondary educa-
tion, career, and adulthood transitions over several years. 
One of the strengths of the HSLS:09 database is that admin-
istrator, student, and teacher survey data were collected and 
can be matched to individual student achievement. Novice 
teachers who had 5 or fewer years of experience were the 
teachers of interest in this study. A total of 2,599 teachers 
were retained for this study. Of these teachers, roughly 15% 
of the teachers in the analytic sample held nonstandard certi-
fications (n = 383 vs. n = 2,216).
Variable Descriptions
Certification status. Students were excluded if their corre-
sponding teachers did not provide information about their 
certification status. Certification status was classified into 
two groups, standard or nonstandard. Standard certification 
(coded as 1) consisted of teachers who were granted regular 
or advanced state certificates or were granted certificates, but 
were on some initial probationary period for novice teachers. 
Nonstandard certification (coded as 0) consisted of teachers 
who were issued certificates that required additional course-
work, tests, or completion of a certification program, and 
teachers who held no certificate.
Achievement. Data from the ninth-grade year (base year; 
2009-2010) and the eleventh-grade year (first follow-up; 
2011-2012) were used in this study to examine differences 
in sustained mathematics knowledge of students who were 
taught by novice teachers who held standard versus non-
standard certificates. Sustained mathematics knowledge 
was assessed by examining standardized algebra scores (M 
= 50, SD = 10) 2 years after having taken Algebra I in 
ninth grade. Given the design of HSLS:09, students were 
given the same algebra test in ninth and eleventh grades, 
thus, the initial test (limited to students who took the alge-
bra exam at the beginning of the algebra course) was used 
as a pretest.","use statistical controls to “level the playing field” to draw

Race. Underrepresented racial2 groups or students who were, 
American Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African Ameri-
can, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific 
Islander, were included as control variables to assess overall 
effects of TPP on student outcomes. These students were com-
pared with Asian, More than One Race, and White students.
Guiding functions. To control for variables that are especially 
critical in reducing bias (see Steiner et al., 2010), mathemat-
ics efficacy, interests, identity, and utility were included as 
covariates. To account for prior experiences before and after 
ninth-grade Algebra I, the guiding functions variables were 
included twice, once as a pretest in ninth grade and again in 
eleventh grade. These variables were created by the HSLS:09 
research team (Ingels et al., 2011) using principal compo-
nents analysis of student survey data. The results were stan-
dardized for the entire sample using a mean of zero and 
standard deviation of one.
Dispositions. Differences in teacher guiding functions and 
dispositions about instructional practices by preparation 
pathway were assessed to provide better guidance for prac-
tice. These dispositions were collected through self-reports 
of survey items ranking a teachers’ emphasis on a Likert-
type scale ranging from no emphasis to heavy emphasis. 
Several dispositions that aligned to Boykin and Noguera’s 
framework (shown parenthetically) were retained for this 
study. Specifically, increasing mathematics interests (guid-
ing functions), standardized test preparation (asset: informa-
tion processing quality), business or industry applications of 
mathematics (meaningful learning), speedy and accuracy of 
computations (asset: information processing quality), teach-
ing mathematics concepts (student engagement), developing 
computational skills (asset: information processing quality), 
developing problem-solving skills (cognitive engagement), 
mathematical reasoning (cognitive engagement), preparation 
for future mathematics study (intersubjectivity), logical 
structure of mathematics (cognitive engagement), history 
and nature of mathematics (culture/intersubjectivity), or 
effectively explaining mathematics ideas (student engage-
ment) aligned to the framework.
Pre- and postmath experiences. To make equivalent compari-
sons, students were included only if they were enrolled in 
Algebra I in ninth grade during the base year. To control for 
variations in exposure to mathematics content, the rigor of 
mathematics courses taken in eighth and eleventh grades 
were also included. Measures of prior achievement included 
standardized algebra pretest scores and letter grades (A-D 
and below D) earned in the eighth-grade math course.
Demographics. A continuous measure of socioeconomic sta-
tus (SES) and a categorical gender variable provided by the 
HSLS:09 team (Ingels et al., 2011) were included as addi-
tional covariates.
Analysis
A series of six regression models that contain a variety of 
approaches (linear, nonlinear, and nonparametric) were com-
pared to address some of the gaps in the literature and assess 
the consistency of teacher certification estimates. Specifically, 
variants of the following models were assessed:

β3 ()Certified URGii×  represents the interaction between 
certification status and underrepresented racial group status,

teacher dispositions to assess whether teacher dispositions 
between certification condition differed relative to underrep-
resented racial groups, where 
Di represents teacher-reported 
dispositions regarding teaching practices. In the second case, 
only interactions between certification condition and under -
represented racial group status are of interest. Thus, the vec-
tor of covariates is excluded.
Model 1 generated population estimates by including all 
covariates using the balanced repeated replication recom-
mended by the HSLS:09 team (Ingels et al., 2011). Models 2 
through 6, employed the marginal mean weighting through 
stratification (MMW-S) procedure to achieve balance 
between the TPP conditions using the pretreatment covari-
ates described in the previous section. However, various 
forms of the model were analyzed. Model 2 employed a non-
parametric approach whereby balance was obtained using 
pretreatment covariates, but no additional covariates were 
modeled. Model 3 included scores of guiding functions 
covariates to capture changes in guiding functions that may 
have occurred after the algebra course. In addition, the math 
pretest covariate was also included as covariate in the model 
to increase robustness. Model 4 employed a different 
approach to capture guiding functions by including gain 
scores for the guiding functions variables between ninth and 
eleventh grade to account for changes that may have occurred 
after completing the algebra course. Model 5 included all 
covariates (similar to the population estimates in Model 1), 
which included two measures of guiding functions, once in 
ninth grade and once in eleventh grade. Finally, Model 6","Race.

included polynomials (quadratic terms) of all continuous 
covariates in attempt to model possible violations of linearity 
assumptions.
Because nonexperimental data were used in this study, the 
MMW-S method was the primary method of interest in this 
study. MMW-S is an innovative nonparametric strategy that 
incorporates strengths of propensity score stratification 
(PSS) and inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting 
(IPTW), but overcomes limitations of PSS and IPTW (Hong, 
2010, 2012). Specifically, MMW-S requires (a) estimation of 
a propensity score based on pretreatment covariates to strat-
ify a sample and (b) computation of a weight for each treated 
unit based on its representation within the associated stratum 
(Hong, 2012). Accordingly, the MMW-S weighting proce-
dure equates the composition of pretreatment variables 
across all treatment groups, simulating a randomized experi-
ment (Hong, 2012). MMW-S is represented in mathematical 
form by the following equation:
MMW S np rZ z
ns
s
z
- = ×= {}
,
where ns is the number of units in stratum s, pr Zz={}  is 
the proportion of the entire sample to the treatment group z, 
and 
nsz ,  is the actual number of units assigned to treatment 
z in stratum s. The numerator represents the expected number 
of units assigned to treatment z in stratum s in a completely 
randomized experiment; whereas the denominator represents 
a nonparametric way to compute the propensity score.
For binary treatments, a six-step analytic process is 
required to employ the MMW-S procedure. The steps 
include (a) estimating a propensity score based on collected 
pretreatment covariates, (b) assuring that each unit has a 
counterpoint in the treatment and control groups (excluding 
if false), (c) stratifying the sample based on the propensity 
score (5-6 strata usually reduces 90% of the variance), (d) 
computing the MMW for each unit in each group, (e) check-
ing to ensure that the weighted sample is balanced across 
groups, and (f) estimating treatment effects (Hong, 2010, 
2012). Treatment effects of MMW-S are aligned with 
Rubin’s causal model to assess differences between two

Appendices A and B describe additional information that 
informed the MMW-S procedures that were used to balance 
the data. For within-study comparison purposes, longitudi-
nal analytic weights and 200 balanced repeated replication 
weights provided by the HSLS:09 team were used to gener -
ate population statistics and appropriate variance estimates 
that account for the multistage sampling design. These pop-
ulation estimates were used to assess similarities and differ -
ences between sample estimates generated using the 
MMW-S procedures. Pretreatment variables for the MMW-S 
procedures included guiding functions variables at early 
enrollment in ninth grade Algebra I, math pretest scores, 
eighth-grade math rigor, eighth-grade math letter grade 
(A-D and below D), whether the student was in the under -
represented racial group category, SES, and gender.
Results
Results show that the main effects for the standard certifica-
tion condition were significant across all six models. All esti-
mates are shared in Tables 1 to 3. Unstandardized regression 
estimates ranged from +1.25 to +1.73 points on the algebra 
examination, which is normed with a mean of 50 and standard 
deviation of 10. Thus, the model predicts that, holding all 
other factors constant in the model, students who were taught 
algebra by certified novice teachers in ninth grade would earn 
higher scores of approximately 1.25 points on the algebra test 
in eleventh grade, relative to students who were taught alge-
bra by teachers who held nonstandard certification in ninth 
grade. Using the most conservative estimate, 1.25 points is 
roughly .13 of the normed standard deviation and .15 of the 
current sample standard deviation (M = 48.75, SD = 8.29). 
Based on published effect-size benchmarks for nationally 
normed tests, the conservative estimate of .13 is approxi-
mately equivalent to 8 months of expected growth from tenth 
to eleventh grade (Hill, Bloom, Black, & Lipsey, 2008). 
When examining interactions between underrepresented 
racial groups and certification condition, there were no sig-
nificant differences noted in any of the models (Tables 1-3).
In terms of dispositions, there were several differences in 
teacher-reported instructional practices between teachers in 
the standard versus nonstandard certification condition. 
Specifically, teachers in the standard certification condition 
(coded as 1) reported higher use of algorithms b = 0.21, 
t(1,966) = 4.56, p < .01 and connecting mathematics  
ideas, b = 0.10, t(1,961) = 2.38, p < .05. Contrarily, teachers 
in the nonstandard certification condition (coded as 0) 
reported higher emphasis on increasing mathematics interests, 
b = −0.17, t(1,967) = −3.41, p < .01, standardized test prep-
aration, b = −0.24, t(1,958) = −4.49, p  < .01, business or 
industry applications of mathematics, b = −0.13, t(1,960) = 
−2.12, p < .05, and speedy and accuracy of computations,  
b = −0.17, t(1,962) = −3.09, p < .01. There were no differ-
ences between the teachers regarding emphasis on teaching 
mathematics concepts, developing computational skills, 
developing problem-solving skills, mathematical reasoning, 
preparation for future mathematics study, logical structure of 
mathematics, history and nature of mathematics, or effec-
tively explaining mathematics ideas. Finally, there was only 
one significant interaction for dispositions, whereby teachers 
in the standard certification condition reported focusing less 
on increasing mathematics interests for underrepresented 
students, b = −0.23, t(1,967) = −2.47, p < .05.
Discussion
The conceptual framework used in the study, known as the 
research-based scheme for promoting enhanced classroom","included polynomials (quadratic terms) of all continuous 
covariates in attempt to model possible violations of linearity 
assumptions.
Because nonexperimental data were used in this study, the 
MMW-S method was the primary method of interest in this 
study. MMW-S is an innovative nonparametric strategy that 
incorporates strengths of propensity score stratification 
(PSS) and inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting 
(IPTW), but overcomes limitations of PSS and IPTW (Hong, 
2010, 2012). Specifically, MMW-S requires (a) estimation of 
a propensity score based on pretreatment covariates to strat-
ify a sample and (b) computation of a weight for each treated 
unit based on its representation within the associated stratum 
(Hong, 2012). Accordingly, the MMW-S weighting proce-
dure equates the composition of pretreatment variables 
across all treatment groups, simulating a randomized experi-
ment (Hong, 2012).

For binary treatments, a six-step analytic process is 
required to employ the MMW-S procedure. The steps 
include (a) estimating a propensity score based on collected 
pretreatment covariates, (b) assuring that each unit has a 
counterpoint in the treatment and control groups (excluding 
if false), (c) stratifying the sample based on the propensity 
score (5-6 strata usually reduces 90% of the variance), (d) 
computing the MMW for each unit in each group, (e) check-
ing to ensure that the weighted sample is balanced across 
groups, and (f) estimating treatment effects (Hong, 2010, 
2012). Treatment effects of MMW-S are aligned with 
Rubin’s causal model to assess differences between two 
population average potential outcomes (Rubin, 1978). 
Appendices A and B describe additional information that 
informed the MMW-S procedures that were used to balance 
the data. For within-study comparison purposes, longitudi-
nal analytic weights and 200 balanced repeated replication 
weights provided by the HSLS:09 team were used to gener -
ate population statistics and appropriate variance estimates 
that account for the multistage sampling design. These pop-
ulation estimates were used to assess similarities and differ -
ences between sample estimates generated using the 
MMW-S procedures. Pretreatment variables for the MMW-S 
procedures included guiding functions variables at early 
enrollment in ninth grade Algebra I, math pretest scores, 
eighth-grade math rigor, eighth-grade math letter grade 
(A-D and below D), whether the student was in the under -
represented racial group category, SES, and gender.

teaching and learning (Boykin & Noguera, 2011), empha-
sized three major domains: classroom-based asset focused 
factors, guiding functions, and student engagement. 
Findings in this study are aligned to this framework in that 
these traits were either related to student outcomes or teach-
ing practices. Teachers from both pathways reported using 
various asset-focused strategies, albeit at differing amounts 
of emphasis, such as enhancing computational skills or 
making mathematics connections to business and industry. 
Moreover, guiding functions, especially mathematics 
efficacy and identity were strongly related to student 
achievement. As demonstrated by Steiner et al. (2010), 
additional covariates, such as mathematics pretests and 
prior mathematics experiences were strongly related to stu-
dent outcomes as well. When accounting for these factors, 
students who were taught by teachers in the standard certi-
fication condition generally earned higher achievement 
scores than those who were taught by teachers from the 
nonstandard condition. However, achievement for under -
represented racial groups was underwhelming for students 
who were taught by teachers in both certification 
conditions.
Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of Model 6, 
the model that used a nonlinear approach and explained the 
most variation (R
2 = .49) out of the six models. Figure 1 is 
presented to describe some of the nuances associated with the 
interaction term between teachers who held standard certifi-
cates versus teachers who held nonstandard certificates, rela-
tive to mathematics achievement. Although statistically 
insignificant, Figure 1 reveals some interesting nuances. First, 
as shown by the left side of the graph, clear distinctions 
between teacher pathways are evident between students who 
were not included in the underrepresented racial group 
(Asian, More than one Race, and White) as compared with 
the students who were included in the underrepresented racial 
group (right side of graph). Specifically, students who were 
not included in the underrepresented racial category achieved 
consistently higher results on the mathematics achievement 
measure. The standard error bars are also narrower in the cer-
tified condition, indicating more consistent outcomes.
The standard error bars shown in Figure 1 relative to 
underrepresented racial group status (American Indian or 
Alaska Native, Black or African American, Hispanic or 
Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) are wider, 
indicating less consistent outcomes. This may be related to 
concepts noted in the literature that teachers of underrepre-
sented students may serve as advocates or resisters (Hill-
Jackson & Lewis, 2010). For example, teachers who held 
standard certificates reported focusing less on increasing 
interests for underrepresented racial groups relative to stu-
dents who were not included in the underrepresented cate-
gory. This finding begs the question of why? These findings 
could highlight systemic bias that has permeated teacher 
training programs (Feagin, 2000) or may denote inappropri-
ate dispositions noted by Milner and Laughter (2015). Thus, 
future research that investigates dispositional differences 
between teachers, connected to student outcomes, may pro-
vide needed insight for better schooling experiences for all 
students, especially for underrepresented racial groups.
Teachers with nonstandard certification indicated that they 
emphasized several key dispositions above the level of 
emphasis used by teachers with standard certification. When 
examining the relationships between teacher dispositions and 
underrepresented groups, teachers with nonstandard certifica-
tion indicated that the emphasized increasing interests more 
so than the teachers with standard certification. However,

more risk for underrepresented racial groups (and all stu-
dents), considering the depressed achievement levels. It is 
not likely that one approach to TPPs will prevail in the United 
States. However, no matter the entry pathway, a healthy bal-
ance between minimizing risk and maximizing outcomes for 
students are essential for effective teacher education policy.
Conclusion
TPPs have historically been essential components of main-
taining inequity in schools (J. D. Anderson, 1998; Milam, 
2010). This study supports this historical phenomenon. In this 
study, regardless of certification status, results are under -
whelming for underrepresented racial groups. These findings 
highlight a need to redefine notions of teacher effectiveness 
and rethink teacher preparation for underrepresented racial 
groups. Additional research that examines variables beyond 
the “usual suspects” and considers the salience of race in edu-
cation and teacher preparation should be considered in the 
future. When discussing race and schooling in the 1930s, W. 
E. B. Du Bois (1935) indicated that a key factor for the proper 
induction of students into life required that teachers develop 
compassionate relationships with students, based on the 
premise of social equality, by obtaining knowledge of indi-
vidual students and understanding the students’ surroundings 
and collective histories. Du Bois’s assertion for teacher prepa-
ration is still relevant today. However, large-scale research 
does not adequately address the collective histories of stu-
dents who are members of underrepresented racial groups.
In this study, I used a within-study comparison approach, 
employing a propensity score framework to generate sample 
estimates and a replication approach to generate national 
population estimates. These approaches diversify the meth-
odology commonly used in large-scale TPP research, allow-
ing for relaxed parametric assumptions and accounting for 
nonrandomized assignment to teacher certification condi-
tions. One of the critiques of using national data sets for 
assessing the relationships between student test scores and 
teachers is that tests are often not aligned with the subjects in 
which the teachers teach (Clotfelter, Ladd, & Vigdor, 2010). 
I address this gap in the literature by limiting the analysis to 
students who (a) were taught Algebra I in ninth grade by 
novice teachers with known certification statuses and (b) 
completed a pre- and post-algebra assessment.
In addition, I addressed gaps in the literature by assessing 
student outcomes and teacher dispositions. These outcomes 
were interpreted by accounting for the historical significance of 
race in education and teacher preparation. I designate this type 
of research as race-conscious research, or research that attempts 
to explain social phenomena or improve outcomes, practices, 
or policies for a specific racial group or groups by interrogating 
assumptions, accounting for current or historical experiences 
of specific racial groups, or examining practices and policies 
that result in differential implementation or outcomes for racial

TPPs have historically been essential components of maintaining inequity in schools (J. D. Anderson, 1998; Milam, 2010). This study supports this historical phenomenon. In this study, regardless of certification status, results are underwhelming for underrepresented racial groups. These findings highlight a need to redefine notions of teacher effectiveness and rethink teacher preparation for underrepresented racial groups. Additional research that examines variables beyond the “usual suspects” and considers the salience of race in education and teacher preparation should be considered in the future. When discussing race and schooling in the 1930s, W. E. B. Du Bois (1935) indicated that a key factor for the proper induction of students into life required that teachers develop compassionate relationships with students, based on the premise of social equality, by obtaining knowledge of individual students and understanding the students’ surroundings and collective histories. Du Bois’s assertion for teacher preparation is still relevant today. However, large-scale research does not adequately address the collective histories of students who are members of underrepresented racial groups.
In this study, I used a within-study comparison approach, employing a propensity score framework to generate sample estimates and a replication approach to generate national population estimates. These approaches diversify the methodology commonly used in large-scale TPP research, allowing for relaxed parametric assumptions and accounting for nonrandomized assignment to teacher certification conditions. One of the critiques of using national data sets for assessing the relationships between student test scores and teachers is that tests are often not aligned with the subjects in which the teachers teach (Clotfelter, Ladd, & Vigdor, 2010). I address this gap in the literature by limiting the analysis to students who (a) were taught Algebra I in ninth grade by novice teachers with known certification statuses and (b) completed a pre- and post-algebra assessment.
In addition, I addressed gaps in the literature by assessing student outcomes and teacher dispositions. These outcomes were interpreted by accounting for the historical significance of race in education and teacher preparation. I designate this type of research as race-conscious research, or research that attempts to explain social phenomena or improve outcomes, practices, or policies for a specific racial group or groups by interrogating assumptions, accounting for current or historical experiences of specific racial groups, or examining practices and policies that result in differential implementation or outcomes for racial groups."

groups. Where appropriate, custodians of knowledge (e.g., edi-
tors, reviewers, and publishers) should consider encouraging 
large-scale TPP researchers to interrogate race-based outcomes, 
teacher dispositions, and practices as well as overall or average 
outcomes, rather than just solely focusing on the latter.
Large-scale, race-conscious teacher preparation research 
that is connected to an array of student outcomes is sorely 
needed and this study is one example. Race-conscious, large-
scale teacher preparation research has the potential to inform 
ideological debates about how teachers should be prepared 
and may lead to broader, more critical empirical perspectives 
for setting teacher preparation policy, especially for under -
represented groups. This study demonstrates that effective 
teachers and their associated dispositions matter, but there is 
much room for improvement. Future research should exam-
ine long-term trajectories of underrepresented racial groups 
based on the certification tracks and dispositions of teachers 
in critical subjects. In sum, effective teachers and teacher 
dispositions are linked to student outcomes; nonetheless 
effectiveness is nuanced and requires structural as well 
teacher preparation reform to enhance outcomes for under -
represented racial groups.

Notes
1. For classification purposes, racial groups that are underrepre-
sented in high achievement categories are referred to as under-
represented racial groups in the article. High achievers exist 
across all racial groups, but when disaggregating students by 
race, several racial groups have lower representation, in high 
achievement categories, relative to their overall population. 
The term “underrepresented” racial group sometimes bears 
a negative connotation. In this article, it simply refers to the 
numerical representation of these students in higher versus 
lower achieving categories relative to their overall representa-
tion in public schools.
2. The term race in this study focuses primarily on socially 
determined race categories that were designated by the 
United States Office of Management and Budget’s Revisions 
to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on 
Race and Ethnicity Census Bureau (Office of Management 
and Budget, 1997). This revision required a minimum 
of six categories for reporting race: American Indian or 
Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic 
or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 
White. This is one perspective of race, but race is socially 
determined and members who are categorized into specific 
categories may reject such designations.
