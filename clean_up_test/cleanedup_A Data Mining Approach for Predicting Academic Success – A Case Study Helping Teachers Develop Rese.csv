Abstract. The present study puts forward a regression analytic model 
based on the random forest algorithm, developed to predict, at an early 
stage, the global academic performance of the undergraduates of a poly- 
technic higher education institution. The study targets the universe of 
an institution composed of 5 schools rather than following the usual p ro- 
cedure of delimiting the prediction to one single speciﬁc degree course. 
Hence, we intend to provide the institution with one single tool capable 
of including the heterogeneity of the universe of students as we ll as edu- 
cational dynamics. A diﬀerent approach to feature selection is propose d, 
which enables to completely exclude categories of predictive va riables, 
making the model useful for scenarios in which not all categories of data
considered are collected. The introduced model can be used at a c en- 
tral level by the decision-makers who are entitled to design action s to 
mitigate academic failure.

The main goal of educational data mining (EDM) is to generate usefu l knowledge 
which may ground and sustain decision-making targeted at impro ving student 
communities’ learning as well as educational institutions’ eﬃci ency . Several sys- 
tematic literature reviews [ 
2– 9] give evidence of the growing importance of EDM 
throughout time and refer and analyse the main research topics in which EDM 
has shown a remarkable contribution as a management analysis and su pport 
tool. Also, such studies provide evidence of the usefulness, potentia l and eﬃcacy 
of the most used data mining methods and algorithms. 
Among the typology of tasks where EDM has shown a remarkable con- 
tribution, we can ﬁnd the prediction of academic performance. This research 
topic is normally approached from three diﬀerent perspectives : predicting school 
dropout, predicting retention, or predicting academic success a t the end of the 
degree course. Literature on EDM has shown that within those studie s, several 
authors over time have studied a number of factors which promote academic suc- 
cess or failure. The main goal of the studies [ 10 , 11 ] was to conduct a review on 
the most used and relevant factors for this kind of predictions. S imultaneously , 
the authors also intended to determine the main data mining method s and algo- 
rithms used in such studies. After analysing a set of 30 studies fo cusing on the 
topic, Shahiri et al. [ 10 ] conclude that 6 attributes are used most frequently . At 
the top of the list is the cumulative grade points average (CGP A), a lmost at the 
same level as the attributes of internal assessment (marks after en tering higher 
education such as assignments, exams, attendance, etc.). Demogra phic features 
and external assessment (pre-university achievement classiﬁ cations) were the 
second group of most used attributes. Finally , the third group of attributes that 
the authors considered to be most used among the set of 6 are the on es related 
to students’ extra-curricular activities and social interaction. 
In a similar study to that by Shahiri et al. [ 10 ], but with the particularity 
of focusing only on research related to students attending instituti ons of the 
traditional on-site system, Del R ´ ıo and Insuasti [ 11 ] conclude that in order to 
infer the ﬁnal mean of the degree course, the authors of a set of 5 1 studies 
released between 2011 and August 2016 used, as predictive var iables, indicators

In this study , we chose to base our predictive model on the random fo rest 
algorithm proposed by Breiman [ 1]. It has shown to have surpassed other tech- 
niques in similar studies due to its predictive capacity and, more importa ntly , 
it allows a good interpretation of its results, in contrast to other t echniques, 
such as Neural Networks and Support V ector Machines, which ar e considered to 
be black boxes. In fact, random forest presents the interesting f unctionality of 
allowing ordering the importance of the predictors which sustain the model. 
F ollowing the procedure commonly adopted, the predictive perf ormance 
of the models considered was evaluated using a k-fold (with k = 10) cross- 
validation. As for the model evaluation metrics, the determination c oeﬃcient 
(R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) were used. 
In order to determine students’ academic performance, the depend ent vari- 
able introduced in expression ( 1) was used as a success indicator, 
dv = average × ects aprov 
ects aprov + ects disaprov , (1) 
where average is the weighted average of the marks obtained in the completed 
course units (CUs), ects aprov is the number of ECTS completed successfully 
and ects disaprov is the number of ECTS in which students enrolled but did 
not pass. Thus, the metric takes into account not only the studen ts’ classiﬁcation 
average but also the fraction of matriculations in course units the y passed (ratio 
of successful ‘attempts’). 
It was possible to consider the time period comprised between 2007/ 2008 
and 2015/2016, totalising 9 consecutive academic years. A choice w as made 
to limit the study to the bachelor degree courses since they are the c ore of the 
institution’s training oﬀer and they encompass a more complete set o f data. After 
a cleaning of data and other pre-processing tasks, the data set th at this study

the period between 2007/2008 and 2015/2016 and started in the period between 
2007/2008 and 2013/2014. 
Regarding the predictive variables of academic success, we co nsidered essen- 
tially the same typology of variables used in the related works of refer ence, 
namely academic data of sociodemographic nature and of access to higher edu- 
cation. The variables under study can be classiﬁed in two impor tant subgroups:

curricular data is the key contributor to the assertive capacity of the model,

academic path. Still, it is interesting to observe that even at a very e arly 
stage of students’ academic course, namely in the 1st and 2nd seme sters, the

the highest determination coeﬃcients using only 2 of the 5 possible ca tegories of

is also the fact that this set of variables also revealed, in additional t ests, the

and the average 1 .105).

its predictions and the degree of anticipation of such predictions . Therefore, it

of their academic path. Instead of following the commonly adopted p rocedure of 
delimiting the prediction to one single speciﬁc course, the mod el was developed 
from a vast real data set involving records of quite heterogeneou s undergraduates 
from over half a hundred degree courses covering a wide varie ty of educational 
ﬁelds taught in the ﬁve schools composing the institution and where each student 
is characterized by more than four tens explanatory variables . Such speciﬁcity 
allowed studying the inﬂuence of a new curricular factor taken into ac count 
for the ﬁrst time in literature: the type of school. The results obtain ed allowed 
concluding that students’ success also depends on the school the y attend. This 
conclusion indicates that in order to mitigate retention and academ ic failure, it 
might be necessary to adopt diﬀerentiated strategies of educatio nal promotion 
according to each school. 
The order of importance provided by the random forest algorithm a llowed the 
identiﬁcation of the factors contributing to students’ success o r failure. It enabled 
the observation that the factors regarding the curricular context of students’ 
academic performance are paramount to the intended prediction , which con- 
ﬁrms results previously obtained by [ 15 ], who stated that such factors can alone 
account for academic performance. Note that all 11 attributes w hich revealed to 
be signiﬁcant for the prediction belong, without exception, to the cu rricular or 
matriculation categories. 
The knowledge obtained allows the identiﬁcation of students at a high er 
risk of retention and academic failure, which enables the institution al managers 
to design more assertive educational or tutorial strategies towa rds educational 
eﬃcacy and eﬃciency . 
The kind of approach adopted in the identiﬁcation of students’ cha racteris- 
tics which best account for their success seems to diﬀer from tha t usually used in 
works related to the same topic. In the present work, the selectio n of those char- 
acteristics was conducted in two diﬀerent stages. First, the selec tion of students’ 
dimensions which best explain their success allowed a ﬁrst ad justment of the 
model by eliminating complete groups of variables. Later, a ﬁne -tuned adjust- 
ment led to the selection of the attributes which were not excluded in t he ﬁrst 
stage. This approach enabled us, in addition to reduce the ‘plague ’ of the data 
dimensionality at an early stage, to exclude completely categories of v ariables, 
without losing the predictive capacity of the model. This feature is of particular 
importance since it contributes to the reduction of the multidisciplina rity of the 
predictors, thereby lowering some of the complexity of the predi ctive process, 
and, more importantly , makes it possible to extend the study to othe r contexts, 
where not all categories of variables initially considered in this study are avail- 
able. 
Note however, that a signiﬁcant part of the results obtained in this study 
cannot be generalized to the whole context of higher education s ince they were 
based on a data sample non-representative of that broader conte xt. This study 
presented a case study focused on IPB, which for being an instituti on of the 
polytechnic higher education subsystem and for being located in an in land region 
with low population density cannot reach the same heterogeneity of students","of their academic path. Instead of following the commonly adopted p rocedure of 
delimiting the prediction to one single speciﬁc course, the mod el was developed 
from a vast real data set involving records of quite heterogeneou s undergraduates 
from over half a hundred degree courses covering a wide varie ty of educational 
ﬁelds taught in the ﬁve schools composing the institution and where each student 
is characterized by more than four tens explanatory variables . Such speciﬁcity 
allowed studying the inﬂuence of a new curricular factor taken into ac count 
for the ﬁrst time in literature: the type of school. The results obtain ed allowed 
concluding that students’ success also depends on the school the y attend. This 
conclusion indicates that in order to mitigate retention and academ ic failure, it 
might be necessary to adopt diﬀerentiated strategies of educatio nal promotion 
according to each school. 
The order of importance provided by the random forest algorithm a llowed the 
identiﬁcation of the factors contributing to students’ success o r failure. It enabled 
the observation that the factors regarding the curricular context of students’ 
academic performance are paramount to the intended prediction , which con- 
ﬁrms results previously obtained by , who stated that such factors can alone 
account for academic performance. Note that all 11 attributes w hich revealed to 
be signiﬁcant for the prediction belong, without exception, to the cu rricular or 
matriculation categories.
