ABSTRACT The advancement of learning analytics has enabled the development of predictive models to
forecast learners’ behaviors and outcomes (e.g., performance). However, many of these models are only
applicable to speciﬁc learning environments and it is usually difﬁcult to know which factors inﬂuence
prediction results, including the predictor variables as well as the type of prediction outcome. Knowing
these factors would be relevant to generalize to other contexts, compare approaches, improve the predictive
models and enhance the possible interventions. In this direction, this work aims to analyze how several
factors can make an inﬂuence on the prediction of students’ performance. These factors include the effect
of previous grades, forum variables, variables related to exercises, clickstream data, course duration, type of
assignments, data collection procedure, question format in an exam, and the prediction outcome (considering
intermediate assignment grades, including the ﬁnal exam, and the ﬁnal grade). Results show that variables
related to exercises are the best predictors, unlike variables about forum, which are useless. Clickstream
data can be acceptable predictors when exercises are not available, but they do not add prediction power if
variables related to exercises are present. Predictive power was also better for concept-oriented assignments
and best models usually contained only the last interactions. In addition, results showed that multiple-choice
questions were easier to predict than coding questions, and the ﬁnal exam grade (actual knowledge at a
speciﬁc moment) was harder to predict than the ﬁnal grade (average knowledge in the long term), based on
different assignments during the course.

better completion rates.
While there are not many cases of interventions being put

ing ways to provide feedback and personalization, such as
Xing and Du [3], who proposed providing individual drop
out probabilities so that instructors could focus on at-risk
students and send them e-mail messages (automatically, as it
is not feasible to send individual e-mails when there are"

thousands of learners) to engage them. For such cases, it will
be important to provide information to the different stake-
holders so managers, instructors and learners are aware of
the situation, and they can reﬂect on what they can do to
improve. For example, aggregated data about learners at risk
of dropout could be provided to instructors as there are thou-
sands of learners in a MOOC. With this information, they can
decide if they want to make any intervention at global scale
(for all those learners at risk and/or to groups which share
certain behaviors). Moreover, some visualizations could be
given to students with the variables that justify that they
may be at risk of dropout (e.g., low activity in videos or
exercises).
Despite this conceptualization for the use of predictions,
one possible issue is that predictive models can be highly
context-dependent [4] and researchers provide results that
may be only applicable to speciﬁc learning environments.
A related open research question is to further explore the
common factors that inﬂuence predictions results so as to be
considered in future models to improve the predictive power.
If we know the factors that inﬂuence prediction and we also
know the values of these speciﬁc factors for a context, then we
can forecast the prediction results and how they might change
from contexts.
Among those factors, the variables used to develop the
models and the way they are collected (e.g., if variables are
collected from the beginning of the course in a cumulative
way or if they are collected in a speciﬁc period) can be
very relevant. As suggested by Moreno-Marcos et al. [5],
selection of data can be even sometimes more important than
the algorithms because variables need to capture appropri-
ate information in relation to the variable to be predicted.
Because of that, it is worth analyzing the predictive power
of different sets of features. In a MOOC, it can be relevant
to analyze to what extent activity in forum can be important
as there are thousands of forum posts and learners provide
information about different aspects, such as social activity,
sentiments and their skills, with the contents of their mes-
sages [6]. In addition, other variables should be analyzed as
important possible factors such as previous performance and
in general, any sets of available variables, as they can add new
information.
However, it is important to note that there can also be
limitations with data, both for the availability and access to
them [7]. This fact can also limit the combination of multiple
sources of data [8] and it also raises the question about which
variables are enough to predict. If some variables are missing
but the predictive power is very high with those present,
the effect of the limitations may be alleviated. In contrast,
if the best predictors are missing, models could achieve
poorer results. In MOOC platforms, it is typical to receive
some data containing information such as the results of the
activities and more detailed data including all the clicks and
events learners perform in the platform (called clickstream).
For example, in the clickstream, there is information about
every click to play a video, pause a video, move forward,
submit an exercise, etc. As this information allows retriev-
ing many additional variables to those obtained with simple
results of the activities, it would be relevant to measure their
relevance in terms of predictive power.
Another important factor in predictions is the course setup
and pedagogy, and aspects such as the course duration,
the format of the assignments and the type of questions in the
exam may also affect the results. For example, the number
of attempts and the persistence [9] (i.e., students’ ability to
keep on working on the tasks despite the difﬁculties) can be
affected depending on the type of activities. While numerical
input questions and open-ended questions (e.g., a program-
ming exercise) can have an unlimited number of attempts,
a student automatically knows the answer when the answer is
incorrect in a true/false question, and this can affect predictive
models.
Furthermore, the prediction outcome that we try to achieve
can affect predictions. The prediction outcome we focus in
this paper is learners’ performance but this can be measured
in different ways. Many MOOCs are only evaluated using
quizzes and assignments (some of them graded using peer-
review) that are usually done during different days or even
weeks throughout the course, but others also incorporate a
ﬁnal exam at the end of the course to measure students’
level of knowledge. As the tasks are different, the predictive
power can vary, and it is relevant to analyze the differences
of the predictive power in the different tasks, including the
intermediate assignments of the course, the ﬁnal exam and
the ﬁnal grade. The analysis of the differences between the
ﬁnal exam grades and the ﬁnal grades based on different
activities during the course are also particularly relevant to
understand whether or not there are differences between the
level of mastery learners show during the course and in a
speciﬁc moment at the end. In addition, few previous research
articles have focused on relating predicting variables, as con-
cluded in a recent review about prediction in MOOCs [10],
and it would be relevant to analyze the relationship between
the predictions of the ﬁnal grade the ﬁnal exam grade,
and which of them can be better predicted with available
data.
In this context, the aim of the paper is to analyze the
inﬂuence of different factors in prediction of students’ perfor-
mance, considering intermediate assignment grades (includ-
ing the ﬁnal exam) and the ﬁnal grade. In this direction,
the article has been organized into four research questions to
guide the analysis. These questions are as follows:
RQ1) Which factors, among previous grades, forum vari-
ables, course duration, type of assignments and data
collection procedures, inﬂuence grades predictions
and to what extent?
RQ2) How does the presence/absence of clickstream data
and interactions with exercises affect prediction
results?
RQ3) How does the question format of the ﬁnal exam
(close-ended and open-ended questions) affect pre-
diction results?

or compare the predictive power between those outcomes.
Fourth, we combine the analysis of several factors affect-

explored in separated works with separated contexts, but we
combine all of these aspects in two different contexts to
gather further conclusions about how these aspects inﬂuence

II. RELATED WORK
In education, researchers have tried to understand and model
learners’ behaviors, such as retention [11], for years. How-
ever, with the introduction of online educational platforms,
it is possible to collect more data to better understand what
it is happening in the course. For example, [12] found that
daily views was a good indicator of student performance
and off-campus activity had higher relationship with perfor-
mance than in-campus activity. With these data, predictive
models have been developed in different contexts. One typ-
ical context is the courses in higher education institutions.
In this case, it is possible to carry out predictions in the
whole academic program (typically dropout [13]–[15]) or
in speciﬁc courses [16], [17]. In the latter case, it is pos-
sible to combine data from several sources. For example,
Christensen et al. [16], [17] predicted exam outcomes using
both self-reported measures and study activities, such as vari-
ables obtained in an online platform (Khan Academy in that
case) or peer-review activities. Moreover, many researchers
have used academic data, such as the CGPA [18]. However,
the latter variables cannot be available if we move to fully
online contexts, such as MOOCs. MOOCs are different from
face-to-face higher education contexts because of the vast
number of students, the methodology, and in most cases
because of the format, which usually combines videos, exer-
cises, and forum for communication. In this paper, we will
focus on the analysis of MOOCs, and from now on, we will
focus on what has been speciﬁcally researched about predic-
tion in MOOCs.
In MOOCs, there is an increasing interest for research
in the last years [10]. For these research works, one of
the initial steps is to deﬁne the variable to be predicted
(i.e., prediction outcome). There are many possible vari-
ables to predict, but the prominent ones in the literature
are related to learners’ behaviors and student performance
(e.g., grades, dropout, etc.), although there can be con-
tributions focused on other issues, such as classifying
forum posts according to their relevance, [19], etc. Among
the ﬁrst category (learners’ behaviors), Bote-Lorenzo and
Gómez-Sánchez [20], for example, developed models to pre-
dict the decrease of engagement in videos, exercises, and
assignments; and Chen et al. [21] predicted the personality of
learners.
However, most of the contributions have focused on
the second category (learners’ performance). In this category,
dropout prediction has a special relevance because of its high
dropout rates. Despite dropouts are not necessarily a problem
since many students access the MOOC just because they want
to explore some contents [22], there is a high interest on it.
In this ﬁeld, for example, Wu et al. [23] developed predictive
models using deep learning and neural networks and features
obtained through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
from raw data. They showed that their method outperformed
other traditional machine learning algorithms, such as Ran-
dom Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc. Particularly, their
AUC (Area Under the Curve), which is a common metric to
evaluate predictive models, was above 0.9 (which is excellent,
according to [10], which also indicates that good AUCs are
above 0.8). In addition, Kloft et al. [24] predicted dropout
over weeks and analyzed how the predictive power improved
over time, which suggests there is a trade-off between antic-
ipation (it is desirable to predict as early as possible) and
predictive power.
Despite the importance of detecting early dropouts, there
are also students who do not drop out the course but they
fail. In order to also detect this situation to make interven-
tions, there are models which focus on forecasting learning
outcomes, such as grades. In this case, some authors have
focused on predicting categorical variables, such as success
(i.e., pass/fail) [25], certiﬁcation at the end of the course [26],
and alphabetical grades (e.g., A to D) [27]. In contrast, other
works have predicted continuous variables about grades. For
example, Ding et al. [28] predicted the grade of each chapter
of the MOOC using features related to videos and naviga-
tion in the MOOC, and Elbadrawy et al. [29] the grade of
homework assignments using data from previous attempted
homework assignments. Pérez-Lemonche, Martínez-Muñoz,
and Pulido-Cañabate et al. [30], in contrast, focused only on
predicting the ﬁnal grade of the course.

However, there are few contributions focused on predicting
grades of the ﬁnal exam of the MOOC, which is very impor-
tant as the ﬁnal exam gives the level of the students after
working on the course. Among those, Ren et al. [31] used
multi-regression models to predict the ﬁnal exam in a MOOC
about Computer Networking, and Pardos et al. [32] used
Bayesian Knowledge Tracing to forecast students’ answers in
multiple tests, including the ﬁnal exam. In addition, research
articles often predict one variable or they predict several ones
separately, but there is not an analysis of how prediction
outcomes are related, which is relevant to understand how
predictive models and predictive power differ when changing
the prediction outcome [10]. In this paper, we will work
in this ﬁeld (in RQ4), and we will analyze the relationship
between the ﬁnal exam grade and the ﬁnal grade. This can
be useful to understand whether or not students’ ﬁnal grades
match with the knowledge they show in the ﬁnal exam, and
it will contribute to the analysis of the relationship between
prediction outcomes, which is a general aspect that needs
further analysis in the literature.
After addressing the variables to be predicted, another
important aspect are the variables used to create the predic-
tive models (i.e., features or predictors). Researchers often
transform the raw events into high-level variables to intro-
duce them in the models. Despite there can be many possi-
ble variables and new variables can be also explored (e.g.,
Maldonado-Mahauad et al. [33] started exploring the effect of
self-regulated learning features), it is frequent to see (1) vari-
ables related to the activity in the platform, (2) variables
related to forum activity, (3) demographic variables, and vari-
ables related to interactions with (4) exercises and (5) videos.
In the ﬁrst category (activity), Alamri et al. [34], for
example, achieved promising accuracies (accuracy metric
was between 0.82 and 0.92) when predicting dropout using
only two features related to the activity, the time spent to
complete each content (articles, images, videos) and the total
number of accesses to the contents. Among variables related
to forum, some examples, used by Klüsener and Forten-
bacher [35], are the number of messages, number of words
in the messages, and number of ratings emitted/received.
However, they are opposite ﬁndings about their effective-
ness in the predictive models of performance as forum vari-
ables can be useful in some contexts (e.g., [36]) but not
in others (e.g., [5]). For example, [36] found that variables
related to the quality/content of the posts, such as the length
of posts, were useful predictors for dropout, while forum
variables were not good predictors at all in the research
by Moreno-Marcos et al. [5] when predicting assignment
grades (even using the same variables). This raises the need
to further analyze this kind of variables in more contexts.
Similarly, demographics variables have also been used in
predictive models, although they may show low predictive
power respect to variables obtained from learners’ interac-
tions, as suggested by Brooks et al. [37]. In their case, they
found low predictive power of variables such as gender, age,
race, language capabilities, geolocation information, whether
a learner was paying for the course or not, and signup date
when they predicted which learners were going to pass.
In contrast, the variables that have been usually proved
to be very effective are those related to exercises.
As an example where this kind of variables stand out,
Ruipérez-Valiente et al. [38] predicted certiﬁcate earners
in a MOOC and found that the strongest predictor was
the progress in problems (i.e., average grade in completed
assignments, which could be multiple choice test of peer
review activities in that MOOC). In addition, Ren et al. [31]
predicted assignment scores using different variables and
found that the number of quizzes the student took before
the assignment was the strongest predictor. Finally, variables
related to videos are also relevant in prediction in MOOCs.
For example, Yang et al. [39] combined assessment grades
with variables about videos interactions (using clickstream
data), such as the percentage of video that the student played,
the average playback rate, the number of rewinds, etc. They
also showed that the combination of different features could
enhance the predictive power.
Apart from the features, there are other aspects that are
also important when developing predictive models. One of
them is the source where data comes from. Typically, data are
gathered from an online platform, such as edX or Coursera,
although other sources (e.g., surveys or an external tool)
can be used [10]. For example, Pérez-Sanagustín et al. [40]
achieved accurate predictions using data outside the MOOC
(from an external tool to support self-regulated learning and
capture data of activity outside the MOOC, such as visited
websites). Moreover, it is important to differentiate between
data about student information and progress, and clickstream
data (i.e., data containing all the events student do in the
platform, such as play, pause, stop a video, submit the solu-
tion of an exercise, etc.) since the latter is not always avail-
able for the analysis (depending on the agreements with the
platform). Some authors, such as Brinton and Chiang [41]
already used clickstream data to forecast if users were going
to have their answers Correct at their First Attempt (CFA)
in a Coursera MOOC about computer networks. They found
that the use of features about video-watching behaviors were
useful to enhance predictive models respect to the perfor-
mance obtained with models based on quiz results (data about
progress). However, clickstream data is not always available,
and, in general, it is not always possible to combine different
features because some of them may be missing in some con-
texts (e.g., a MOOC with just a ﬁnal exam at the end would
not allow collecting information about partial performance).
Because of that, it is important to understand which sets
of features are the best predictors and which variables are
enough to predict with appropriate results (e.g., if clickstream
data is necessary to achieve accurate predictions, which is
addressed in RQ2).
In relation to the last aspect, the course context is very
important (which can limit other aspects such as features,
as seen before). In order to delve into different contexts, some
authors have analyzed different MOOCs to understand the
VOLUME 8, 2020 5267","However, there are few contributions focused on predicting
grades of the ﬁnal exam of the MOOC, which is very impor-
tant as the ﬁnal exam gives the level of the students after
working on the course. Among those, Ren et al. used
multi-regression models to predict the ﬁnal exam in a MOOC
about Computer Networking, and Pardos et al. used
Bayesian Knowledge Tracing to forecast students’ answers in
multiple tests, including the ﬁnal exam. In addition, research
articles often predict one variable or they predict several ones
separately, but there is not an analysis of how prediction
outcomes are related, which is relevant to understand how
predictive models and predictive power differ when changing
the prediction outcome. In this paper, we will work
in this ﬁeld (in RQ4), and we will analyze the relationship
between the ﬁnal exam grade and the ﬁnal grade. This can
be useful to understand whether or not students’ ﬁnal grades
match with the knowledge they show in the ﬁnal exam, and
it will contribute to the analysis of the relationship between
prediction outcomes, which is a general aspect that needs
further analysis in the literature.

Moreno-Marcos - 2020 - Analysis of the Factors Influencing Learners’ Performance Prediction With Learning Analytics.pdf,"P. M. Moreno-Marcoset al.: Analysis of the Factors Influencing Learners’ Performance Prediction With Learning Analytics
differences of the predictive models in different contexts.
For example, Qiu et al. [42] developed predictive models
in 11 MOOCs (ﬁve sciences and six non-sciences MOOCs) to
predict certiﬁcate earners and assignment grades using demo-
graphic variables and variables related to forum activity and
learning behaviors. They achieved strong predictions in both
sciences and non-sciences courses. Given that models may
not work when changing the context, others have evaluated
the generalizability of the models. This is very important to
guarantee a long-term sustainability of the models [43] (i.e.,
models need to be valid not only for the course used to train
the models, but for other courses, as generating models to
only be used once would limit their use and their regularly
adoption in the institutions in the long term). The topic of
generalizability is of real interest nowadays and a recent
special issue about early prediction of student performance
highlights it as one of the main current research topics [44].
Among research in this ﬁeld, Boyer and Veeramacheni [45]
considered three editions of a MOOC (Spring 2012, Fall
2012, and Spring 2013) and tried to develop predictive mod-
els to be used in consecutive editions (e.g., train using data
from Spring 2012 and make predictions on learners in the
Fall 2012 or Spring 2012 edition). However, they found that
the predictive power got worse, which suggests that it is
difﬁcult to ﬁnd generalizable models. In addition, Kizilcec
and Halawa [46] trained models using 20 MOOCs and they
suggested that using data from multiple MOOCs can improve
the generalizability.
However, apart from making models generalizable to other
MOOCs, it is important to analyze to what extent the fac-
tors that inﬂuence those models are the same in different
contexts. In this line, there are few contributions. In one of
them, Gardner et al. [47] evaluated the results of a previous
work of dropout prediction in other MOOCs and found that
some research results (regarding algorithms and features used
to predict) were the same while others indicated just the
opposite. In order to get more insight about the factors inﬂu-
encing the predictions, this work will analyze the inﬂuence
of different factors (mainly in RQ1) and several of them are
replicated in two MOOCs as part of the methodology to delve
into this issue. For example, one of these factors is about how
predictive power differ depending on the type of questions.
An early work concluded that open-ended assignments are
harder to predict than close-ended ones [5] (typically more
concept-oriented) with variables mainly about exercises, but
further research is needed in that area, and particularly in the
ﬁnal exam, where the context is different (e.g., different way
to ask the question, length of the task, way to evaluate, etc.).
This will be addressed in RQ3.
In summary, this paper aims to contribute with the analysis
of different factors that can inﬂuence predictions of grades.
First, factors such as the inﬂuence of previous grades, forum
variables, course duration, type of assignments, and data
collection procedures are addressed. These factors have been
linked together because they can be validated with a second
MOOC, and they will provide insight about what factors
are more relevant when designing predictive models so as
to be considered in the implementation. Second, this paper
aims to contribute with a deeper analysis of which features
are more relevant in the predictions and how the predictive
power can be limited when some of them are missing, par-
ticularly focusing on multiple edX sources, which can be
of interest because of the vast number of MOOCs based on
the edX platform. Previous works have focused on which
variables have been the best predictors (e.g., [38]), but it
is also important to be aware of the effects of data source
limitations (i.e., limitations produced when not all the data
are available) in the predictive models. This is relevant as
not all kind of variables can be always gathered (e.g., there
can be a context where interactions with videos cannot be
obtained) and models often need to be developed with lim-
ited datasets. Third, this paper incorporates a novel analysis
focused on the ﬁnal exam and its different components to
delve into the differences on the predictive power depending
on the kind of questions. Finally, the paper will innovate with
the analysis of the relationship of the ﬁnal grade and the
ﬁnal exam. This contributes with the analysis of the relation-
ship between prediction outcomes, where more research is
needed [10].
III. METHODOLOGY
In this paper, data from two MOOCs are considered. One of
the MOOCs was already analyzed in a previous work in terms
of prediction [5]. In this work, we take the results from this
previous work [5] just for RQ1 and compare them with the
results of the new MOOC, which was not considered before.
This way, some factors of predictions can be validated in
at least two MOOCs. In addition, we add new analyses for
the new MOOC from RQ2 onwards. These new analyses are
only done with the new MOOC because the methodology of
the course and available data does not allow these analyses
in the MOOC analyzed our previous work [5], and they
add new insight about factors inﬂuencing predictive models.
This section aims to introduce the context of those courses,
the variables and data collection for the analysis, and the
analytical methods and measures, including the algorithms
and metrics to evaluate the results, and the way to measure
the dependent variables of the analyses.

This MOOC is the ﬁrst one of a trilogy of courses for learning
Java from scratch. The analysis of this MOOC can be found in
a previous article, and this paper will refer to the results pre-
sented there [5] and will compare these results with respect
to the second MOOC (in RQ1) as way to validate ﬁndings.

Science and Technology (HKUST) and will be used for the
whole analysis.
Despite both MOOCs are on the same topic, the course
design and methodology are different, and that could affect
the predictive models. A comparison of the characteristics of
the MOOCs can be found in Table 1.
Table 1 shows that the duration of the HKUST MOOC
is double (10 weeks) than the UC3M MOOC (5 weeks).
There are signiﬁcant overlaps between the topics covered
by both MOOCs although some topics are covered at dif-
ferent levels of details. Both MOOCs were instructor-paced,
so the contents were released gradually and learners had
speciﬁc deadlines to complete the assignments, although the
pedagogical approaches were different. UC3M MOOC was
more focused on the concepts, and it was evaluated through
seven assignments, which consisted of ﬁve close-ended tests
(one each of the ﬁve weeks of the course, counting 15%
each) and two peer-review programming assignments in week
3 and 5 (counting 10% and 15%, respectively). Moreover,
it contained 135 close-ended short formative questions which
do not count for the ﬁnal grade, which needed to be above
60%, the passing rate, to pass (regardless the grade of speciﬁc
items).
In contrast, HKUST MOOC was more lab-oriented, which
assesses mastery of concept as well as skill. In that MOOC,
labs consisted on several programming tasks (typically
4-5 exercises for each lab) in which students needed to
submit their Java code, which was automatically assessed.
The evaluation consisted of these automated graded labs
(which were six and the top 5 grades counted 20%,) plus
one project (with one automated graded part and another
with peer-review, which counted 20%), and a ﬁnal exam,
which counted 40% of the ﬁnal grade. In this case, students
needed to get at least 50% of the points (regardless the
grade of speciﬁc items) to pass. The six labs were part of
weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8, the project was released on week
5 although the deadline was on week 9, and the ﬁnal exam
was administered on the last week (week 10). Additionally,
the MOOC contained 42 short exercises (both conceptual,
e.g., multiple-choice questions, and about coding, e.g., writ-
ing a short piece of code) intended to prepare learners for
the assignments. These short exercises were automatically
graded and counted towards the remaining 20% of the ﬁnal
grade.
The number of videos is also higher in the HKUST MOOC,
which could be expected as the duration is higher. Regarding
the population, enrolled users in the UC3M MOOC is double
that of HKUST, although the number of learners who actu-
ally passed the course and engaged in the activities in the
UC3M MOOC was only slightly higher. The demographics
about the two MOOCs are also similar, with a median age
of 30 years and 70% of learners are university degree holders
for both MOOCs. Geographically-wise, ﬁgures were also
similar. Most students came from USA in both MOOCs (25%
in both MOOCs), followed by India (18% in the HKUST
MOOC and 16% in the UC3M MOOC). The third country
with more learners was Spain in the UC3M MOOC (3%),
while United Kingdom in the HKUST MOOC (3%).
B. VARIABLES AND DATA COLLECTION
In order to analyze the data of the MOOCs, data from edX
have been collected. Particularly, the following sources from
edX have been considered [48].
• {org}-{course}-{run}-course_structure-{site}-analytics.
json: Contains the structure of the course and all its
assessment items.
• {org}-{course}-{run}-courseware_studentmodule-{site}
-analytics.sql: Contains the state of learners in each
course components.
• {org}-{course}-{run}-{site}.mongo: Contains the forum
messages and the information about the forum interac-
tions.
• {course_id}-grade_report_{datetime}.csv: Contains the
grades of the learners in each assessed activity.
• {org}-{site}-events-{date}.log.gz.gpg: Contains the
low-level users generated events when they interact with
the platform, i.e., clickstream data.
The ﬁrst four ﬁles are available in both MOOCs and
they serve to obtain variables related to the interactions with
exercises (second ﬁle) and forum (third ﬁle) in the differ-
ent parts of the course (following the structure in the ﬁrst
ﬁle). The second ﬁle also gives information about which
videos have been opened, but not about how much they
have been watched. Comprehensive information about inter-
actions with videos and activities, including the events of
clicks learners had with the platform (e.g., when user plays
a video, pauses it, etc.), i.e., clickstream data, is obtained
using the ﬁfth ﬁle. However, last ﬁle is only available in the
HKUST MOOC.
With regard to the methodology for using the data, in order
to have comparable results with those obtained in the UC3M
MOOC, the sample selection criteria for the HKUST MOOC
are the same as in the UC3M MOOC [5], and consists on

The number of videos is also higher in the HKUST MOOC,
which could be expected as the duration is higher. Regarding
the population, enrolled users in the UC3M MOOC is double
that of HKUST, although the number of learners who actu-
ally passed the course and engaged in the activities in the
UC3M MOOC was only slightly higher. The demographics
about the two MOOCs are also similar, with a median age
of 30 years and 70% of learners are university degree holders
for both MOOCs. Geographically-wise, ﬁgures were also
similar. Most students came from USA in both MOOCs (25%
in both MOOCs), followed by India (18% in the HKUST
MOOC and 16% in the UC3M MOOC). The third country
with more learners was Spain in the UC3M MOOC (3%),
while United Kingdom in the HKUST MOOC (3%).
B. VARIABLES AND DATA COLLECTION
In order to analyze the data of the MOOCs, data from edX
have been collected. Particularly, the following sources from
edX have been considered.
• {org}-{course}-{run}-course_structure-{site}-analytics.
json: Contains the structure of the course and all its
assessment items.
• {org}-{course}-{run}-courseware_studentmodule-{site}
-analytics.sql: Contains the state of learners in each
course components.
• {org}-{course}-{run}-{site}.mongo: Contains the forum
messages and the information about the forum interac-
tions.
• {course_id}-grade_report_{datetime}.csv: Contains the
grades of the learners in each assessed activity.
• {org}-{site}-events-{date}.log.gz.gpg: Contains the
low-level users generated events when they interact with
the platform, i.e., clickstream data.
The ﬁrst four ﬁles are available in both MOOCs and
they serve to obtain variables related to the interactions with
exercises (second ﬁle) and forum (third ﬁle) in the differ-
ent parts of the course (following the structure in the ﬁrst
ﬁle). The second ﬁle also gives information about which
videos have been opened, but not about how much they
have been watched. Comprehensive information about inter-
actions with videos and activities, including the events of
clicks learners had with the platform (e.g., when user plays
a video, pauses it, etc.), i.e., clickstream data, is obtained
using the ﬁfth ﬁle. However, last ﬁle is only available in the
HKUST MOOC.
With regard to the methodology for using the data, in order
to have comparable results with those obtained in the UC3M
MOOC, the sample selection criteria for the HKUST MOOC
are the same as in the UC3M MOOC, and consists on"

ﬁltering students who did not engage with the course and
they did not participate in the forum. This produces a ﬁltered
dataset of 2,168 learners in the HKUST MOOC. Moreover,
the same variables are collected to ensure the replicability
of the experiments in RQ1. Nevertheless, related to RQ2,
additional variables are collected from the clickstream (ﬁfth
ﬁle) to analyze whether they can enhance the predictive
models (these variables were already used in another previous
work [43]). Table 2 presents the list of independent variables
used in the study. In that table, variables in bold are obtained
from the clickstream and thus they are only available in the
HKUST MOOC.
These variables can be gathered using two modes, which
are worth analyzing to discover the best way to collect data so
as to capture the most representative variables. These modes
are the cumulative and non-cumulative mode. Cumulative
mode means that they are collected from the beginning of
the course until a speciﬁc moment (e.g., end of week X),
and non-cumulative means that they are collected within
a speciﬁc period (e.g., from the release of week X to the
deadlines of that week). In the analysis, we will refer to the
general term ‘‘data collection procedure’’ to refer the mode
use to collect the data.
C. ANALYTICAL METHODS AND MEASURES
In order to develop predictive models, it is necessary to deﬁne
the predictors. However, it is also important to deﬁne the
variables to be predicted, i.e. the prediction outcomes. In this
case, the prediction outcomes are the grades of each of the
graded assignments of the MOOC (including the ﬁnal exam).
There are seven graded assignments in the UC3M MOOC
(ﬁve close-ended tests and two programming assignments)
and nine in the HKUST MOOC (six labs, the automatic
graded component of the project, the peer-review component
of the project, and the ﬁnal exam). These grades are measured
in scale 0-1, as they appear in the grade report. Moreover,
the learning outcome (pass/fail) is also considered in the
analysis when analyzing the prediction of the ﬁnal grade
and the ﬁnal exam. For this case, a binary variable is used,
whose value is 1 if the grade is above the passing rate, and
0 otherwise.
With these deﬁnitions of the variables, predictive models
are generated using the sklearn1 library of Python in the Ana-
conda platform, and four well-known predictive algorithms:
(1) Regression (RG), (2) Support Vector Machines (SVM)
with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and epsilon =0.01,
(3) Decision Trees (DT), and (4) Random Forest (RF) with
500 estimators. With these algorithms, results are retrieved
using 10-fold cross validation. The parameters of the algo-
rithms not mentioned before are the default values in the
sklearn implementation.
In order to measure the performance of these algorithms,
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) has been used when pre-
dicting scores, as suggested by Pelánek [49], who preferred
this metric respect to others, such as MAE (Mean Absolute
Error), which are biased towards the majority result. More-
over, AUC is used when predicting the learning outcome, as it
is generally appropriate for student behavior classiﬁcation
problems [49], and avoids some problems in imbalanced
datasets [50].
Despite RMSE and AUCs are recommended for this con-
text and they will be used to report results in Section IV ,
an Appendix is included with the results using other metrics.
The reason for this appendix is that many articles often use
other metrics (although these metrics may not be the best) and
this appendix will allow researchers comparing their results
when other common metrics in the literature are used. Partic-
ularly, two metrics are included: MAE for grades’ predictions
and F-score for pass/fail predictions. In the Appendix, it can
be seen that the main conclusions in the educational ﬁeld are
the same, but it is relevant to report other metrics to better
compare research results.

four research questions.

A. RQ1: INFLUENCE OF PREVIOUS GRADES, COURSE
DURATION, TYPE OF ASSIGNMENTS, FORUM VARIABLES
AND DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE
The ﬁrst part of the analysis aims to analyze the inﬂu-
ence of different factors that can affect the predictive power
when predicting learners’ performance in assignment grades"
Moreno-Marcos - 2020 - Analysis of the Factors Influencing Learners’ Performance Prediction With Learning Analytics.pdf,"P. M. Moreno-Marcoset al.: Analysis of the Factors Influencing Learners’ Performance Prediction With Learning Analytics
(including the ﬁnal exam) of a MOOC. In particular, the pre-
diction factors that are addressed in this section are as follows:
a) The inﬂuence of previous performance on graded
assignments on the prediction of future assignment
grades.
b) The inﬂuence of course duration on the prediction of
assignment grades.
c) The inﬂuence of the type of assignments (concept-
oriented vs. lab-oriented) in the predictive power of
assignment grades.
d) The inﬂuence of forum variables on the predictive
models to predict grades of assignment grades.
e) The inﬂuence of the data collection procedure (cumu-
lative vs. non-cumulative, as explained in Section 3.B)
in the predictive power.
In order to analyze these factors, six models have been cre-
ated using different sets of variables for the two MOOCs.
These models were also used in a previous work [5], so it
is possible to compare the results because the same condi-
tions are applied. For Models A-E, variables are collected
in non-cumulative mode (with variables collected within the
week where the assignment is due). In contrast, Model F
uses cumulative mode (with variables collected from the
beginning of the course to the deadline of each assignment).
The purpose of Model F is to compare the data collection
procedure and it is used with the same variables as Model A,
following the methodology used in a previous work [5].
A summary of these models is as follows:
• Model A: Variables related to problems and per_open
• Model B: Model A plus previous grades of graded
assignments.
• Model C: Variables related to forum.
• Model D: Model A plus variables related to forum.
• Model E: Model B plus variables related to forum.
• Model F: Variables of Model A in cumulative mode.
With each model, grades of the different graded assignments
have been predicted. For the case of the UC3M MOOC,
grades are predicted for the close-ended tests ( Ti), the pro-
gramming assignments ( Pi) and the ﬁnal grade ( FG), where i
indicates the week where each assignment is placed. Results
for this MOOC are taken from a previous article [5] and
can be found in Table 3. These are the only results taken
from another article. The rest of them are new. For the case
of the HKUST MOOC, grades are predicted for the six
labs (Li), the project submission ( PS) with automatic grading,
the project submission with peer-review ( PR) and the ﬁnal
exam (FE). The week where assignments are due is indicated
as W i. These results are in Table 4. Note that FG is not
predicted yet in the HKUST MOOC because variables related
to exercises cannot be used as all of them count towards
FG (20%). This is different in the UC3M MOOC where there
are 135 short formative exercises which do not count for the
FG at all.
A ﬁrst look at Tables 3 and 4 shows that the best val-
ues in both tables are in Models B and E, which are the

models that include the previous grades of graded assign-
ments. This ﬁnding suggests that previous performance (and
particularly in graded tasks) is among the strongest predictors
of future performance, as also shown in other contributions
(e.g., [38] found grades in assignments was the best predictor
for dropout). Moreover, another common ﬁnding in both
MOOCs is that the predictive power tends to be better in the
last assignments. This can probably be because as the course

exercises.
evolves, more data are available and less students interact
with the course, which makes it is easier to separate between
those who are engaged and those who are not. However,
at the beginning of the course, there can be learners who
‘‘sample’’ some activities to explore the course but they
are not committed to do it (known as sampling learners by
Maldonado-Mahauad et al. [51]).
For these MOOCs, an important difference is the duration,
which is double in the HKUST MOOC. However, the engage-
ment (measured with the number of learners interacting with
the MOOC components) follows a similar exponential pattern
for both videos and exercises (Fig. 1), with a prominent drop
in the ﬁrst 2-3 weeks. This entails that although the number
of committed learners drops every week and that may affect
the longer course, there are not many differences due to the
course duration since the most critical weeks are the ﬁrst
ones in both MOOCs. This also supports the fact that the
improvement of the predictive power is higher in the ﬁrst few
weeks than in consecutive weeks.
Another signiﬁcant difference is that the predictive power
is generally slightly worse in the HKUST MOOC than in the
UC3M MOOC. A possible reason can be related with the type
of questions. HKUST MOOC is mostly assessed based on
labs (lab-oriented approach). In the UC3M MOOC, the pre-
dictive power is signiﬁcantly higher for graded tests (concept-
oriented) than for programming assignments (lab-oriented),
and the predictive power of most of HKUST assignments is
similar to P3 in UC3M MOOC. The fact that the prediction
of FE of HKUST MOOC (which contained 30 multiple-
choice concept-oriented questions and lab-oriented coding
questions) is signiﬁcantly higher can also support this ﬁnd-
ing. The implication is that lab-oriented tasks can be more
difﬁcult to predict. A deeper analysis on the differences of
the predictive power depending on the type of questions will
be provided in RQ3.
With regard to the forum variables, results show that they
do not improve signiﬁcantly the models in neither of the
MOOCs for the different algorithms. While learners were
highly encouraged to use forum in both MOOCs, the HKUST
FIGURE 2. Prediction of grades using data from previous topics in the
HKUST MOOC.
MOOC also had speciﬁc formative activities to be solved in
the forum with hundreds of responses (one activity had 826
responses), although they did not contribute to improve the
predictive power of forum variables. Moreover, the forum of
the HKUST MOOC seemed to work very well with 94% of
threads with response and an average time of response of six
hours. These facts can also support that forum activity is not
directly related to the learning outcomes.
Finally, another difference is related to the use of
cumulative/non-cumulative mode. While it is always better
to use data of only the current week at UC3M, that does
not always happen at the HKUST MOOC. To explore further
into this ﬁnding, Fig. 2 illustrates the prediction of different
assignments using both modes over time (using models A and
F with RF, as used in the analysis of the UC3M MOOC [5]).
The ﬁgure shows that unlike in the UC3M MOOC, it is not
clear which mode is better. Non-cumulative mode is better
for some tasks but not for others, and there are some tasks
(e.g., FE) where the best mode varies along the timeline.
A possible reason for this is that the HKUST MOOC has con-
siderably fewer short exercises (there are only 3-4 exercises
per week), which can make variables be less representative in
non-cumulative mode and achieve worse predictive power.
Moreover, the ﬁgure also shows that it is difﬁcult to achieve
accurate predictions until the latest stages of the course in
the HKUST MOOC. The higher standard deviation between
the results of each task for each student in the HKUST
MOOC respect to UC3M MOOC (0.29 vs 0.14) can also
make grades more difﬁcult to be predicted. This fact is also
related to the anticipation. Results show that the predictive
power improves week by week and as the predictive power is
not very accurate until the last stages, it is not possible to get

those who are engaged and those who are not. However,

labs (lab-oriented approach). In the UC3M MOOC, the pre-
dictive power is signiﬁcantly higher for graded tests (concept-
oriented) than for programming assignments (lab-oriented),
and the predictive power of most of HKUST assignments is
similar to P3 in UC3M MOOC. The fact that the prediction
of FE of HKUST MOOC (which contained 30 multiple-
choice concept-oriented questions and lab-oriented coding
questions) is signiﬁcantly higher can also support this ﬁnd-
ing. The implication is that lab-oriented tasks can be more
difﬁcult to predict. A deeper analysis on the differences of
the predictive power depending on the type of questions will
be provided in RQ3.
With regard to the forum variables, results show that they
do not improve signiﬁcantly the models in neither of the
MOOCs for the different algorithms. While learners were

MOOC also had speciﬁc formative activities to be solved in
the forum with hundreds of responses (one activity had 826

predictive power of forum variables. Moreover, the forum of
the HKUST MOOC seemed to work very well with 94% of

directly related to the learning outcomes.

cumulative/non-cumulative mode. While it is always better
to use data of only the current week at UC3M, that does
not always happen at the HKUST MOOC. To explore further
into this ﬁnding, Fig. 2 illustrates the prediction of different
assignments using both modes over time (using models A and
F with RF, as used in the analysis of the UC3M MOOC [5]).

clear which mode is better. Non-cumulative mode is better
for some tasks but not for others, and there are some tasks
(e.g., FE) where the best mode varies along the timeline.
A possible reason for this is that the HKUST MOOC has con-
siderably fewer short exercises (there are only 3-4 exercises
per week), which can make variables be less representative in
non-cumulative mode and achieve worse predictive power.
Moreover, the ﬁgure also shows that it is difﬁcult to achieve
accurate predictions until the latest stages of the course in
the HKUST MOOC. The higher standard deviation between
the results of each task for each student in the HKUST
MOOC respect to UC3M MOOC (0.29 vs 0.14) can also
make grades more difﬁcult to be predicted. This fact is also
related to the anticipation. Results show that the predictive
power improves week by week and as the predictive power is
not very accurate until the last stages, it is not possible to get"
Moreno-Marcos - 2020 - Analysis of the Factors Influencing Learners’ Performance Prediction With Learning Analytics.pdf,"P. M. Moreno-Marcoset al.: Analysis of the Factors Influencing Learners’ Performance Prediction With Learning Analytics
very accurate predictions soon. While there is always a trade-
off between anticipation and predictive power, these results
may suggest that predicting one week ahead could be a good
option to avoid losing much predictive power and allowing
some anticipation (predictions in the last moment are useful
to identify factors but not to make impact on learners).
In summary, both courses have in common that the predic-
tive power improves over the time in a similar way, with pre-
vious grades as strong predictors and low predictive power of
forum variables. Moreover, both courses share a similar curve
of decrease of engagement over time, and not with the propor-
tion of the completion of the courses. However, the predictive
power is generally worse in the HKUST MOOC, although
the predictive power when predicting the labs is comparable
with similar programming tasks in the UC3M MOOC. This
suggests that the type of assignment may affect the results,
and concept-oriented tasks can be easier to predict, as con-
cluded in a previous work [5]. The prediction mode also
presents differences and it is less clear in the HKUST MOOC,
perhaps because of the few activities to be considered in
the non-cumulative mode and more lab-oriented assessments.
This may imply that further analysis can be done in the
HKUST MOOC to analyze whether if could be beneﬁcial to
include more tasks and explore a better predictive model for
lab-oriented skill-based activities.
B. RQ2: EFFECT OF CLICKSTREAM DATA AND VARIABLES
RELATED TO EXERCISES ON PREDICTION
The second part of the analysis aims to analyze the effect of
the clickstream data (data containing the events generated by
learners when they make clicks in the platform). As these data
are not always available (e.g., UC3M MOOC), the HKUST
MOOC is used for this objective. It is relevant to know their
relevance in their predictive models, if their inclusion can
improve the predictive power and discover if it is enough
with courseware data. In order to analyze this question, two
additional models have been deﬁned:
• Model G: Variables obtained from the clickstream (vari-
ables in bold in Table 2 plus per_open, which is included
as it can be also computed with clickstream and it com-
pletes the set of variables related to activity and videos),
i.e. just using clickstream data.
• Model H: Model E plus variables obtained from the
clickstream
On the one hand, Model G has been selected as a base
model to know how much predictive power can be achieved
with just the information about videos and activity provided
by the clickstream. On the other hand, Model H has been
chosen as an extension of Model E, which was the more
comprehensive model without clickstream and the model
which achieved better results. Therefore, Model H would be
the most comprehensive model as it contains all the variables.
Note that it is normally possible to collect the same
variables collected from the courseware using the click-
stream. Therefore, in this case, when we refer to clickstream,
TABLE 5. Results of the predictive models using the clickstream data in
the HKUST MOOC.
we focus on the variables about videos and activity, that
can only be retrieved with clickstream data and not with the
courseware and other data. However, in this context, it is note-
worthy that variables related to exercises cannot be retrieved
from the clickstream since many problems are graded with an
external grader and the events do not record the grade. This is
a limitation, although it is not impeding for the study as they
are available in the courseware. Taking the new models into
account, results are presented in Table 5.
Results show that the variables added with the clickstream
(related to activity and videos) do not offer a signiﬁcant
increase of predictive power and Model H achieves similar
results to Model E, which means that variables obtained from
clickstream data do not improve the predictive power and
they do not add new insights in the prediction if the variables
considered in model E are taken into account. This also
implies that the analysis with courseware data (as it was done
with the UC3M MOOC) can be enough to achieve predictive
power as it captures the best predictors.
In order to delve into the best predictors, the importance of
variables has been computed for the RF models with Model H
(see details of calculation in the article by Louppe et al. [52]).
Fig. 3 shows the results of the variables with higher impor-
tance (normalized, so the sum of all variables for each task
is 1). This ﬁgure clearly indicates that variables related to
exercises are the best predictors. The average grade is a
strong predictor for most of the assignments and particularly
in cumulative mode (and this result matches in the UC3M
MOOC). Moreover, previous grades are also very strong
predictors. Particularly, grade from the previous lab is the
best predictor for L4 to L6 and for PR and PS. This high-
lights the importance of past performance to predict future
performance. The fact that the previous grades lose predictive
power after the following assignments may mean that the last
performance can be the best predictor. The few exercises for
each week can suppose a limitation when considering the
latest interactions, though. Nevertheless, this result servers to
justify that variables related to exercises are crucial to develop
the predictive models. If they can be obtained from the click-
stream, results can be accurate; otherwise the clickstream
without these variables may not be enough, as corroborated
by the poorer results of Model G.
However, for the prediction of FG, variables related to
exercises cannot be used because all exercises are part of
VOLUME 8, 2020 5273","very accurate predictions soon. While there is always a trade-
off between anticipation and predictive power, these results
may suggest that predicting one week ahead could be a good
option to avoid losing much predictive power and allowing
some anticipation (predictions in the last moment are useful
to identify factors but not to make impact on learners).
In summary, both courses have in common that the predic-
tive power improves over the time in a similar way, with pre-
vious grades as strong predictors and low predictive power of
forum variables. Moreover, both courses share a similar curve
of decrease of engagement over time, and not with the propor-
tion of the completion of the courses. However, the predictive
power is generally worse in the HKUST MOOC, although
the predictive power when predicting the labs is comparable
with similar programming tasks in the UC3M MOOC. This
suggests that the type of assignment may affect the results,
and concept-oriented tasks can be easier to predict. The prediction mode also
presents differences and it is less clear in the HKUST MOOC,
perhaps because of the few activities to be considered in
the non-cumulative mode and more lab-oriented assessments.
This may imply that further analysis can be done in the
HKUST MOOC to analyze whether if could be beneﬁcial to
include more tasks and explore a better predictive model for
lab-oriented skill-based activities.
B. RQ2: EFFECT OF CLICKSTREAM DATA AND VARIABLES
RELATED TO EXERCISES ON PREDICTION
The second part of the analysis aims to analyze the effect of
the clickstream data (data containing the events generated by
learners when they make clicks in the platform). As these data
are not always available (e.g., UC3M MOOC), the HKUST
MOOC is used for this objective. It is relevant to know their
relevance in their predictive models, if their inclusion can
improve the predictive power and discover if it is enough
with courseware data. In order to analyze this question, two
additional models have been deﬁned:
• Model G: Variables obtained from the clickstream (vari-
ables in bold in Table 2 plus per_open, which is included
as it can be also computed with clickstream and it com-
pletes the set of variables related to activity and videos),
i.e. just using clickstream data.
• Model H: Model E plus variables obtained from the
clickstream
On the one hand, Model G has been selected as a base
model to know how much predictive power can be achieved
with just the information about videos and activity provided
by the clickstream. On the other hand, Model H has been
chosen as an extension of Model E, which was the more
comprehensive model without clickstream and the model
which achieved better results. Therefore, Model H would be
the most comprehensive model as it contains all the variables.
Note that it is normally possible to collect the same
variables collected from the courseware using the click-
stream. Therefore, in this case, when we refer to clickstream,
we focus on the variables about videos and activity, that
can only be retrieved with clickstream data and not with the
courseware and other data. However, in this context, it is note-
worthy that variables related to exercises cannot be retrieved
from the clickstream since many problems are graded with an
external grader and the events do not record the grade. This is
a limitation, although it is not impeding for the study as they
are available in the courseware. Taking the new models into
account, results are presented in Table 5.
Results show that the variables added with the clickstream
(related to activity and videos) do not offer a signiﬁcant
increase of predictive power and Model H achieves similar
results to Model E, which means that variables obtained from
clickstream data do not improve the predictive power and
they do not add new insights in the prediction if the variables
considered in model E are taken into account. This also
implies that the analysis with courseware data (as it was done
with the UC3M MOOC) can be enough to achieve predictive
power as it captures the best predictors.
In order to delve into the best predictors, the importance of
variables has been computed for the RF models with Model H
(see details of calculation in the article by Louppe et al.).
Fig. 3 shows the results of the variables with higher impor-
tance (normalized, so the sum of all variables for each task
is 1). This ﬁgure clearly indicates that variables related to
exercises are the best predictors. The average grade is a
strong predictor for most of the assignments and particularly
in cumulative mode (and this result matches in the UC3M
MOOC). Moreover, previous grades are also very strong
predictors. Particularly, grade from the previous lab is the
best predictor for L4 to L6 and for PR and PS. This high-
lights the importance of past performance to predict future
performance. The fact that the previous grades lose predictive
power after the following assignments may mean that the last
performance can be the best predictor. The few exercises for
each week can suppose a limitation when considering the
latest interactions, though. Nevertheless, this result servers to
justify that variables related to exercises are crucial to develop
the predictive models. If they can be obtained from the click-
stream, results can be accurate; otherwise the clickstream
without these variables may not be enough, as corroborated
by the poorer results of Model G.
However, for the prediction of FG, variables related to
exercises cannot be used because all exercises are part of"

FG. Therefore, models have to be developed using only inter-
actions with videos, forum and the activity in the platform.
In this case, a model has been developed using forum vari-
ables and per_open (videos), which are the only available
without the clickstream, and another model also including
the clickstream. The evolution of the predictive power for
both the prediction of the score and the learning outcome
(pass/fail) using the most consistent algorithms in the analysis
(RG and RF) are presented in Fig. 4.
Results show that despite clickstream does not consider-
ably enhance the models when variables related to exercises
are present (as seen in Table 5), they are relevant when no
other information is available. This can be seen (in Fig. 4)
with the high difference between models with and without
clickstream for the FG where exercises cannot be used. The
best RMSE at the end of the course is 0.18, which means that
while there are errors in the prediction, it is possible to give
a good estimation (in comparison with other works, such as
the article by Pérez-Sanagustín et al. [40], where the best
RMSE was 0.18 at the end of the course) of the range of
the grade. Furthermore, prediction of the learning outcome
provides better results and it is possible to predict with good
results (AUC above 0.8) from week 4 (40% of the course) and
excellent (AUC above 0.9) from week 7 (70% of the course).
These results are worse than in the UC3M MOOC (good AUC
from week 1 and excellent from 20% of course duration),
but they can still provide early predictions to be used in live
courses.
In summary, variables related to exercises are very relevant
for achieving strong predictions. If they cannot be used, the
predictive power could still be acceptable in later stages of
the course, but the use if preferable. The positive point for
edX researchers if that courseware data provides information
about exercises, and it is possible to develop strong models
with just that information, which is easier to handle than
clickstream (in the HKUST MOOC, courseware data was
about 600 MB, while clickstream was about 20 GB). Never-
theless, if clickstreams have the information about exercises,
their use can also get insight about learners’ behaviors while
achieving accurate predictions. Moreover, clickstream data
could also provide formative feedback to the instructors on
improving the instructional design.
C. RQ3: EFFECT OF THE QUESTION FORMAT IN
PREDICTION OF THE FINAL EXAM
One particularity of the HKUST MOOC is that it contains
a ﬁnal exam, unlike many other MOOCs. This exam was
divided into two main components: 30 multiple-choice ques-
tions (MC, 2 points each) and automated-graded coding prob-
lems (CD, 10 points each). As previous results suggest that
there may be differences because of the type of assignment
(e.g., lab grades may be difﬁcult to predict), it is interesting
to delve into the differences of the type of questions of the
exam, which is the only task which combines close-ended
(MC) and open-ended (CD) questions. In order to do that,
grades for each component of the exam (MC and CD) have
been separated and predictive models have been developed to
predict each separate component. Fig. 5 depicts the evolution
of the predictive power when predicting the different compo-
nents of the exam using Model H (which is used because it
contains all possible the interactions and it outperforms most
of the models) and RG and RF as algorithms (SVM and DT
have been removed to make the plot clearer as their predictive
power was worse).
Fig. 5 clearly shows that the predictive power of CD
is worse than the predictive power of MC and FE. This
result matches with previous ﬁndings about the difference
of prediction between close-ended (as MC) and open-ended

(as CD) questions [5], and the ﬁnding we obtained about the
predictive power of HKUST assignments, which was gener-
ally worse probably because of the type of questions (they
were mostly open-ended tasks). In contrast, the predictive
power is very similar for the FE and MC. This means that
the prediction of FE is not highly affected because of the
CD, which are harder to predict, and this is good. Results
also show that the non-cumulative mode is better for all the
components, which entails that the latest interactions are the
best predictors. As mentioned previously, as many learners
who are not committed to engage in the course interact at
the beginning, initial interactions can introduce noise in the
model, and thus the latest interactions are preferable. In terms
of the algorithms, RG and RF achieve similar results, as it
happened in previous ﬁndings, which suggests that strong
predictors are linearly related with the outcome. In fact,
at the end of the course, the correlation between the vari-
ables related to exercises with higher importance in Fig. 3
(avg_grade, attempted, avg_attempts, and CFA) is higher
than 0.8 for all variables.
Results also show that the best predictive power for both
MC and FE is 0.16 at the end of the course and 0.21 for CD.
This means that it is possible to give a good estimation of the
range of the grade (as happened with FG) for the different
components, although predictions of CD are worse. If pre-
dictions are only carried out as pass/fail, AUC (see Fig. 6)
are above 0.8 for all components from week 3 and above
0.9 from week 6. This entails that while CD can reduce the
anticipation and predictive power for the grade, they do not
for the learning outcome, which is positive, as the mixture of
both kind of tasks can be enriching for making learners master
both conceptual and practical skills. In fact, this suppose that

parts of FE can be accurate predicted even before half of
the course, which is good. Moreover, the fact that accurate
results can be achieved from the ﬁrst weeks means that it
is possible to obtain early predictions so as to be used for
prevent learners’ failure.
D. RQ4: COMPARISON OF THE PREDICTIVE POWER
BETWEEN FINAL EXAM GRADE AND FINAL GRADE
In this section, our main objective is to compare the predic-
tive power that we can achieve between FE and FG. In the
HKUST MOOC, the FE represented 40% of the FG, so it is
expected to be high representative of the FG, but there are
some patterns that are worth analyzing. In order to analyze
the differences, Fig. 7 represents the relationship between
both grades. It can be seen that for passing grades, there is
a positive linear relationship between FE and FG (correlation
of 0.95 using all points, and 0.58 using only learners who
passed the exam). Moreover, there are many learners who
did not take the exam. Almost all of them failed the course
and probably were dropouts, although there are 12 cases of
learners who had reached the minimum 50% required to pass
without the FE and they did not take it. Furthermore, there
were very few cases in the dataset (n =48) of students who
failed the exam, which means that those who took it generally
passed, and from those who failed, 52% of them passed the
course. Therefore, it can be said that both grades are very
highly related and almost all learners who passed the course
also passed their FE.
Taking into account that both grades are closely related,
it is interesting to analyze the differences of the predictive
power of the models to forecast both the FG and the FE
depending on the prediction outcome. As one limitation when

predicting FG is that it cannot be predicted using variables
related to exercises because they are part of the FG, models
for both prediction outcomes use variables related to activity,
videos and forum (as it was done in RQ2 with FG). This
way predictions of the FG will comparable to those with the
FE as the predictors are the same. Considering this model,
the evolution of the predictive power for the FG and FE
is presented in Fig. 8. In addition, in order to understand
the relationship between the variables, an additional model
has been included to predict FG using only the predictions
obtained with the model of FE (one predictor variable).
A ﬁrst observation is that the predictive power of the FG is
almost always better than the prediction of the FE, and more
time is needed to get accurate predictions of the FE (e.g.,
RMSE reaches about 0.2 in week 8 for FG and week 10 for
FE). This suggests that the average knowledge in the long
term is harder to forecast than the actual knowledge at a spe-
ciﬁc moment. With regard to the data collection procedure,
non-cumulative mode seems to be the best for both prediction
outcomes, so it should be preferred. Another observation
is that the predictive power obtained when predicting FG
using only the predictions of the FE is not so different to the
model used to predict FG with learners’ interactions. While
differences are higher in the ﬁrst stages (particularly with
RF), results are very similar in later stages. This entails that
due to the high (and linear) relationship between both grades,
as shown in Fig. 7, it is possible to predict FG from just
the predictions of the FE without losing so much predictive
power. This result implicates that prediction outcomes can be
sometimes related and further research can be done to analyze
the relationship between prediction outcomes, as suggested
by [10], which identiﬁed this lack of research in their liter-
ature review. Nevertheless, the ﬁnding about FG is easier to
predict than the FE can be relevant and can be considered in
the implementation of predictive systems in live MOOCs.
V. DISCUSSION
In this paper, an analysis of students’ performance prediction
has been carried out analyzing some factors inﬂuencing the
prediction, some of them related to the predictor variables,
others to the prediction outcomes, and others related to the
methodology of the analysis or the course. This study took
the same methodology as a previous work [5] to conduct
the analysis. This means that the same features, algorithms,
ﬁltering criteria and predictive models (models A to F), etc.
were used in this analysis. However, there were important
differences in the analysis of both works that are worth
mentioning. First, the analysis of the inﬂuence and/or impor-
tance of clickstream data (Research Question 2) is new in
this contribution. Second, there was not FE in our previous
work [5], and therefore the analysis of the FE and its rela-
tionship with FG is new (Research Question 4). Third, the
typology of closed-ended and open-ended items was differ-
ent, which made Research Question 3 different from what
has done in our previous work [5]. UC3M MOOC had close-
ended assignments and peer-review assignments, while in
the HKUST MOOC, we only focused in one exam which
combined different types of activities. In addition, the nature
of open-ended tasks was different. In the UC3M MOOC,
open-ended tasks were peer-reviewed, so their evaluation
had a subjective factor. In contrast, in the HKUST MOOC,
the open-ended tasks we analyzed in Research Question 3
were part of an exam, and they were automatically graded,
so grading was more objective. Furthermore, they were small
exercises that involved writing single methods whereas the
UC3M MOOC open-ended tasks were similar to the labs in
the HKUST MOOC (they both involved more complex tasks
than coding questions of the HKUST exam, and they usually
involved several Java methods). Therefore, their compari-
son is different in each case, although they share that there
were close-ended and open-ended activities in both cases.
Finally, the comparison of the results of the two MOOCs

on the same topic but with different teaching methodology
(Research Question 1) is new from this paper and relevant to
analyze how research results can generalize.
Considering the previous differences, in the two con-
sidered MOOCs, it was observed that the best predictors
were variables related to exercises and particularly, grades
from previous assignments were very strong predictors. This
matches with contributions which suggest that previous per-
formance is useful to forecast future performance. For exam-
ple, Ruipérez-Valiente et al. [38] found that the best predictor
was the grade achieved in the completed assignments when
predicting dropout in a MOOC. In addition, Pigeau et al. [25]
found that marks in quizzes where the best predictors when
predicting success (i.e., who passes the course) in 12 MOOCs
on programming languages, project management and startup
creation.
Furthermore, the analysis of the HKUST MOOC corrobo-
rates that forum variables are not strong predictors. A possible
reason can be because learners posted very few messages
(42% of contributors in the HKUST MOOC only posted
one message and 68% in the UC3M MOOC). Although
results could differ in other contexts (such as in the article by
Klüsener and Fortenbacher [35], where they obtained good
accuracies when predicting success with and features such
as the number of up-votes), this result suggests that forum
variables may not be useful for predictions unless speciﬁc
conditions are met. For example, it could be interesting to
further analyze this issue in a MOOC where involvement in
the forum was crucial and also analyze the effect of passive
participation (e.g., users who read what others have done, but
never post messages).
In addition, results showed that the predictive power in the
ﬁrst weeks was worse, probably because there were less data
available and there were many learners who were exploring
the course at initial stages but they were not committed to do
the course. This lack of commitment was also observed with a
decrease of engagement (i.e., activity) in videos and exercises
over time, and it was also reported in other contributions
(e.g., [24], [28]). Moreover, it was found that this decrease
of engagement over weeks was found to be similar in both
MOOCs (there was an exponential decrease in both MOOCs)
despite the course duration was different. In contrast, a dif-
ference between both analyzed MOOCs was that the non-
cumulative mode was not always the best in the HKUST
MOOC, which suggests that non-cumulative mode could be
limited if there are very few exercises in each module, as in
this MOOC.
In terms of predictive power, results obtained were sim-
ilar to those obtained in other contributions. For example,
Pérez-Sanagustín et al. [40] obtained an RMSE of 0.18 when
using all the interactions and RF to predict the overall grade,
which is similar to the performance obtained here (best
RMSE in the HKUST MOOC is 0.16 for FE). Moreover,
Elbadrawy et al. [29] obtained RMSEs between 0.15 and
0.23 when predicting assignment grades in a MOOC using
regression models (although no information is known about
the kind of assignments and course methodology). This show
that the values obtained here are similar to those obtained
in other works. It may be possible to improve the models
since our work does not focus on obtaining the best tuned
model, as Ding et al. [28] did when incorporated more
complex models using neural networks to predict grades of
each chapter (their RMSEs improved from 0.25-0.40 to 0.12-
0.15). However, the results presented here can be considered
accurate enough so as to be used in real contexts and provide
predictions that accurately indicate the range of grade (e.g.,
between 70-80%) the student is going to achieve.
In addition, a sensitivity analysis also showed that predic-
tive models seemed to be robust. We measured how a percent
increase of each variable (20%, as used by Hamby [53])
affected the prediction of grade of each assignment (using
Model H, which contains all variables and RF, which is one
of the most consistent algorithms in the analysis). Results
showed that these variations in the input produced variations
in the output smaller than 0.01 (and only 0.01 with per_vtotal
in L1 and avg_rep in PS), which barely affect results. More-
over, the rate between the percentage of variation in output
and input was low in most of the cases, which implies that
models are barely affected by the uncertainty in the input.
The analysis also concluded that clickstream data (in this
case including information about interactions with videos
and access to the platform) could not considerably improve
the predictive power when variables related to exercises
were available (e.g., average grade or previous summative
grades). However, clickstream data were useful to predict
when information about exercises was missing (assuming that
we exclude events about exercises from the clickstream cate-
gory, although they are usually available in the clickstream
and they could fall into this category). This suggests that
researchers can develop accurate predictive models whenever
variables related to exercises are available (as in the course-
ware data of edX) and in this case, other data limitations may
be alleviated. Nevertheless, in the absence of variables related
to exercises, it can be possible to develop acceptable models,
as Alamri et al. [34] did, where not all weeks had quizzes
to be used in the predictions, and they achieved accurate
predictions of dropout based on variables related to activity
(which are obtained here through clickstream).
With regard to the analysis of FE, results showed that
the predictive power can vary depending on the type of
questions, as also happens with the format of assignments
(with concept-oriented assignments easier to predict than
lab-oriented ones) and happened in a previous work [5].
In this case, MC are easier to predict than CD, which focus
more on the assessment of skill. Furthermore, results showed
that predictions of the FE and the FG were very related, and
predictions of the FE could be used to predict FG without
losing much predictive power. However, results showed that
FG was easier to predict than the FE, which entails that the
average performance in the long run may be easier to predict.
Finally, despite obtaining several conclusions about the
factors affecting predictions, it is important to discuss about

(Research Question 1) is new from this paper and relevant to

Considering the previous differences, in the two con-
sidered MOOCs, it was observed that the best predictors
were variables related to exercises and particularly, grades
from previous assignments were very strong predictors. This
matches with contributions which suggest that previous per-
formance is useful to forecast future performance.
Furthermore, the analysis of the HKUST MOOC corrobo-
rates that forum variables are not strong predictors. A possible

VI. CONCLUSION
This paper has analyzed several factors affecting predictions
of grades in a MOOC. Results showed that the best vari-
ables were those related to exercises, and forum variables
were not useful to predict. Clickstream data was found to
be acceptable predictors when exercises variables were not
available, but they did not enhance the predictive power when
the latter were present. Predictive power was also better for
concept-oriented assignments and best models usually con-
tained only the last interactions. In addition, results showed
that multiple-choice questions were easier to predict than
coding questions, and the ﬁnal exam grade was harder to
predict than the ﬁnal grade, based on different assignments
during the course.
Despite these ﬁndings, there are some limitations that
are worth mentioning. In this study, two MOOCs on the
same topic but using different pedagogical approaches are
compared. However, it would be relevant to analyze more
courses to get further conclusions about the generalizability
of the ﬁndings. In addition, there are some limitations related
to the methodology. First, one limitation is about the way
to ﬁlter students. Although this is a common limitation in
MOOCs, where there are many learners who do not interact
with the platform and need to be removed, there can be dif-
ferent criteria and they could affect the results. For example,
instead of ﬁltering out those who did not participate in the
forum, we could have ﬁltered those students who had not
completed any assignment. Second, we gathered the variables
at the end of this week as we were more focused on the
factors that affect prediction than early prediction. For an
analysis of early prediction, it would be better to stop the data
collection some days before the deadline. Third, the analysis
is based on a deﬁned set of features, but other features could
have been deﬁned (e.g., navigation patterns, variables about
self-regulation) and these features could also be relevant in
the analysis. Fourth, the analysis is carried out with certain
algorithms. More algorithms and more complex ones, such
as neural networks, could be used to analyze whether they
can improve the predictive power.
As future work, some other factors can be analyzed to get
insight about whether or not they can have an inﬂuence on

the predictive power. Some of these factors can be the use of
new variables, the thematic area of the course, the evaluation
system (e.g., analyzing differences between a mid-term and
ﬁnal exam grade), etc. In addition, it will be interesting to
incorporate more courses with more different settings to have
a better validation of the results. Moreover, it will be relevant
to analyze how other prediction outcomes can be related,
for example, drop out and ﬁnal grade, etc. In addition, more
research can be done on the type of exam questions, and their
difﬁculty could be also analyzed to see if it also affects the
predictive power. Finally, it would be important to develop
systems that make use of these predictions in order to inform
instructors and learners so that predictions can actually con-
tribute to the improvement of success in MOOCs.

(MAE is below 0.1, which means that the errors are in average
of only some tenths).
Finally, Fig. 13 presents the comparison between the pre-
dictive power of the FG and the FE. In that ﬁgure, it can also
be observed that FE is generally harder to predict, although
in this case, the predictive power is very similar (even better
for the FE) when all (or almost all) interactions are available
(weeks 9 and 10). This ﬁnal improvement was also present
in Fig. 8 although RMSE was better for FG prediction. This
result serves to make note that while FE is harder to pre-

(weeks 9 and 10).

5280 VOLUME 8, 2020","FIGURE 13. Comparisons of predictive models to forecast FE exam and
FG.
and F-score, respectively. The ﬁgure shows that MC is easier
to predict and the predictive power achieves are very good
(MAE is below 0.1, which means that the errors are in average
of only some tenths).
Finally, Fig. 13 presents the comparison between the pre-
dictive power of the FG and the FE. In that ﬁgure, it can also
be observed that FE is generally harder to predict, although
in this case, the predictive power is very similar (even better
for the FE) when all (or almost all) interactions are available
(weeks 9 and 10). This ﬁnal improvement was also present
in Fig. 8 although RMSE was better for FG prediction. This
result serves to make note that while FE is harder to pre-
dict, it can be as easy as the FG when the exam is near
(weeks 9 and 10).
