ABSTRACT
Currently, limited data are available on student retention rates and 
attrition factors in online physical education (OLPE) courses. Several 
early OLPE studies as well as the 2007 NASPE Initial Guidelines for 
Online Physical Education have suggested that certain prescreening 
efforts be in place prior to student enrollment in OLPE; however, at 
present no such empirically sound and theoretically based screening 
instruments exist. The purpose of the study is to identify online stu -
dent cognitive characteristics and environmental factors associated 
with success and/or failure within college online health-related fitness 
(HRF) courses. Students (N = 821) enrolled in a 16-week online HRF 
course at a university during the Fall 2017 participated in the study. 
Data were collected at the beginning of the course with two previously 
validated research instruments, the Educational Success Prediction 
Instrument Version-2 (ESPRI-V2) and the Distance Learning Survey 
(DLS). Results reveled a relationship between course completion and 
six variables: GPA, class standing, hours worked outside of school, 
achievement, organization and study environment). The full model 
containing all predictors was statistically significant (χ 2 (6, 
N = 821) = 94.296, p <.001), indicating that the model was able to 
distinguish between students who completed and did not complete 
the online course. This analysis provides an initial understanding of the 
unique student characteristics affecting OLPE course completion.
Introduction
Distance education programs provide students the flexibility and access to education that 
may not be readily available otherwise. Distance education programs have become increas -
ingly popular as institutions look to not only cut cost, but to also expand beyond their 
traditional regions without investing in brick and mortar operations (Saba, 2005 ). Recent 
estimates indicate 5.8 million high school students will enroll in online courses (Allen & 
Seaman, 2016 ). This upward trend is likely to continue as states such as Virginia, Alabama, 
Florida, Michigan, Idaho, New Mexico and Georgia enact legislation that mandates students 
complete an online course as a high school graduation requirement (Kennedy & 
Archambault, 2012 ; Rice & Yang, 2013 ). While online learning has been practiced for 
over two decades, the amount of research has not kept pace with its rapid expansion 
(Barbour, 2010 ; Rice, 2006 ). It has been suggested a next step for research in this K-12 
field is greater examination between subject areas and educational contexts (Smith, Clark, & 
Blomeyer, 2005 ). However, not all disciplines have fully embraced online education.

Goad - 2020 - Predicting Student Success in Online Physical Education.pdf,"Hesitancy to support online delivery within the physical education profession has been 
evident (Daum & Buschner, 2014 ). Physical education content primarily focuses on pro -
moting healthy lifestyles through physical activity and the teaching of fundamental motor 
skills and movement patterns (Buchanan & Brock, 2016 ; Rink, 2013 ). Concerns within 
online physical education (OLPE) surround instruction, assessment, and accountability of 
physical activity completed by students (Daum & Buschner, 2012 ; Mohnsen, 2012 ; Society 
of Health and Physical Educators [SHAPE], 2007 ). Despite these concerns, OLPE is 
becoming more prevalent. According the 2016 SHAPE of the Nation Report, 31 states 
allow students to satisfy required physical education credits online, with the number of 
states that permit OLPE having increased by 11 since 2010.
In response to the emerging trend of OLPE in K-12 settings, national governing bodies 
such as SHAPE America established guidelines for OLPE. The 2007 SHAPE America Initial 
Guidelines for Online Physical Education offer suggestions OLPE course content, site 
management, instructional design, technology, and assessment. These guidelines are used 
to inform the OLPE program development and provide a framework for evaluating courses 
currently being delivered in K-12 and post-secondary settings alike. However, at the time of 
their formation, only a single peer-reviewed OLPE research study (Goc Karp & Woods, 
2003 ) was available to inform the guidelines.
Although OLPE practices have expanded across the country since the 2007 SHAPE 
America Initial Guidelines for OLPE, research in the area remains limited. Initial studies 
provide a foundation for understanding the characteristics of OLPE stakeholders and 
highlight areas that warrant further investigation. Research in this area raises questions 
about course delivery, design, and instructional methods in relation to student learning and 
fitness gains (Daum, 2012 ; Daum & Buschner, 2012 ; Daum & Woods, 2015 ; Futrell, 2009 ; 
Goad & Jones, 2017 ; Goc Karp & Woods, 2003 ; Kane, 2004 ; Mosier, 2010 ; Mosier & Lynn, 
2012 ; Williams, 2014 ). However, limited work within OLPE has focused program char -
acteristics that accommodate learner needs and promote successful completion of OLPE 
courses in both K-12 and university settings.
Conceptual frameworks guiding online course design
Many Internet and web-based health behavior interventions are grounded in behavior 
change theories such as Self Determination Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action, Social 
Cognitive Theory, and account for the challenges associated with individual persistence 
and goal attainment, yet none account for the influence of administering the intervention 
online (Ritterband, Thorndike, Cox, Kovatchev, & Gondev-Frederick, 2009 ). The conceptual 
framework used to inform the current study is the Online Behavior Change Model, which 
was designed to help guide the development and explain health behavior change produced by 
Internet interventions. The Online Behavior Change Model provides a framework to develop 
and enhance online health-related fitness (HRF) courses by helping to conceptualize, identify, 
and measure factors affecting instructors (e.g., course design and delivery, mid-course 
adaptations) and students (e.g., persistence and successful course completion).
In 2012, Hilgart, Ritterband, Thorndike, and Kinzie proposed a reorganization of the 
Online Behavior Change Model into three process-oriented segments: 1) analysis, 2) eva -
luation, and 3) strategy to better guide and support the use of the Internet in the delivery of 
discipline-specific content (Hilgart, Ritterband, Thorndike, & Kinzie, 2012 ). Process models

and student characteristics. Online course components such as appearance, content deliv -
ery, student use, and support represent variables that can be responsive and influenced by 
student and environmental characteristics (Ritterband et al., 2009 ). The reorganization 
provides a theoretical-based approach for identifying and targeting factors contributing to 
student persistence, attrition, and drop out, specifically related to user and environmental 
factors.
Ritterband et al. ( 2009 ) describe user characteristics (i.e. gender, age, ethnicity, etc.) as 
fixed; however, we posit they can still be influenced by environmental factors such as family, 
friends, employer, school, or societal-level influences such as social media, policy, and other 
cultural factors. These environmental factors can then affect website use and student 
persistence through an online course. Instructional frameworks that account for the impact 
of the Internet on variables such as user characteristics and environmental factors can help 
guide OLPE programs better accommodate and respond to the needs of the modern 
student. The current study focuses on the analysis segment of the framework and examines 
user and environmental characteristics that may help predict student success and persis -
tence within OLPE courses.
Examining barriers to student success in online learning assist in the development of 
early warning systems for OLPE programs. Currently, data are limited in the area of student 
retention and attrition rates in OLPE. Mosier’s 2010 investigation of the K-12 Florida 
virtual schools (FLVS) OLPE program offered insight to student demographic data such 
as age, gender, ethnicity, GPA, reasons for enrolling, and completion rates. The study found 
that 52% of students were designated as completers (n = 10,333), 40% non-completers 
/never activated/no grade (n = 8,054), and 8% non-completers, who withdrew or failed the 
course (n = 1,557). Moiser’s findings did not provide explanations of factors that contrib -
uted to student completion. In fact, very few studies have explored the potential factors 
associated with retention and attrition in OLPE. While Ransdell et al ( 2008 ) suggested 
program quality was a primary factor linked to student dropout, others have attributed 
dropout rates in online physical activity courses to lack of support, poorly designed courses, 
and inexperienced and/or incompetent instructors (Brewer, 2001 ).
Despite the growing body of knowledge in online student success and retention, attrition 
rates still pose a significant problem to distance education programs (Alem, Plaisent, 
Bernard, & Chitu, 2014 ; Hart, 2012 ; Simpson, 2013 ). Intervention strategies relating to 
online course delivery, faculty interventions and advisement have been shown to be 
increasingly effective. However, factors associated with the learner and learning environ -
ment must also be identified and better understood to effectively support at-risk students 
these through intervention strategies (Hilgart et al., 2012 ; Ritterband et al., 2009 ).
Identifying factors that influence student completion or non-completion in OLPE 
courses would provide valuable information for students, academic advisors, online 
instructors, instructional designers, and K-12 and post-secondary administrators.

facilitate student success.
The purpose of the study was to identify student characteristics and environmental 
factors associated with success and/or failure within OLPE courses. Four research questions 
guided the study: (1) To what extent do student cognitive characteristics influence success 
in a university-level OLPE course? (2) To what extent do student demographics influence 
course completion in a university-level OLPE course? (3) To what extent do student 
environmental characteristics influence course completion in a university-level OLPE 
course? (4) What combination of student cognitive characteristics, environmental charac -
teristics, and demographics produce a model that best predicts course completion in 
university-level OLPE courses?
Methods
Participants and setting
Students (n = 862) enrolled in a 16-week OLPE course at a university in the southeast region 
of the United States during the Fall 2017 semester were invited to participate in the study. 
The university was selected as the site of the study due to their implementation and 
development of model OLPE courses grounded in the Appropriate Instructional Practice 
Guidelines for Higher Education Physical Activity Programs (Melton, Russell, Moore, & 
Sweeney, 2009 ; Russell, Wadsworth, Hastie, & Rudisill, 2014 ). The asynchronous online 
course is designed to expose students to the basic concepts associated with the development 
and maintenance of physical activity. Instructors of the OLPE course are graduate assistants 
trained by the program coordinator on the proper procedures of delivering the course. 
Specifically, the pre-course orientation focuses on effective instructional technology use and 
online pedagogy (Russell et al., 2014 ). Instructors of the OLPE course are primarily 
responsible for maintaining gradebooks and communicating with the students (Brock, 
Wadsworth, Hollett, & Rudisill, 2016 ). The course delivery, presentation of content, assess -
ment and grading are standardized across all sections of the OLPE courses. Quizzes and 
fitness tracking goals were automatically assessed by the institutional learning management 
system.
Survey instruments
To address the research questions, two validated research instruments founded in models of 
attrition and retention to identify factors influencing the success and failure in online 
learning environments were used, the ESPRI Version-2 (Roblyer et al., 2008 ) and the 
Distance Learning Survey (DLS; Osborn, 2001 ). Instruments such as the ESPRI-V2 and 
DLS have been used to identify the potentially successful and at-risk students who enroll in 
online courses (Osborn, 2001 ; Roblyer et al., 2008 ). The survey instruments define student 
success as ‘one who completes a course with a passing grade and failure as either non- 
completion or completion with a failing grade. For the purposes of the current study the 
pass/fail criteria were defined as: students completing the course with a grade of A, B, or 
C were designated as completers (i.e. passing); students who withdrawal (W), drop (I), or 
complete the course with a grade of D or F were identified as non-completers.

technology use/self-efficacy, (2) achievement beliefs/locus of control, (3) instructional 
risk-taking, and (4) organization strategies. Within each construct, respondents indicate 
their level of agreement (strongly disagree 1 – strongly agree 7). The ESPRI-V2 was found 
to have a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.92) among its four 
factors (Roblyer et al., 2008 ). While the ESPRI-V2 addresses student cognitive character -
istics, the survey items associated with those factors pertain to the high school aged 
population and did not account for concerns relevant to those enrolled in post-secondary 
education; therefore, Osborn’s ( 2001 ) DLS was used to address student environmental 
and demographic characteristics as items within each construct focus on college and 
university-age population. High internal consistency of the DLS (Cronbach alpha = 0.90) 
has been reported among the factors measured (Osborn, 2001 ).
The two surveys were pilot tested with four sections of the OLPE course during the 
Summer 2017 term. Minor edits were made to survey questions and protocol instructions as 
a result of the pilot study. For the current study, the single-item predictor variables as well as 
the financial support and study environment factors relating to a collegiate population from 
each of the two instruments – Roblyer’s et al. ( 2002 , 2008 ) ESPRI-V2 and Osborn’s ( 2001 ) 
DLS – are outlined in Table 1 .
The survey items were built into the learning management system (LMS) course shell for 
all OLPE course section to be completed as a pre-course task. Students had two weeks at the 
beginning of the term to respond to the Pre-semester survey that took approximately 
15 minutes to complete. Data from the surveys were automatically collected in the institu -
tion LMS grade recording tool. Student responses were exported from the LMS as 
a Microsoft Excel file, de-identified, and assigned a research code by a person uninvolved 
in the research to ensure participant anonymity. Incomplete and duplicate survey responses 
were removed from the final data set before data were inputted into SPSS version 21.
Data analysis
To examine the relationship between each of the independent variables (cognitive, envir -
onmental, and demographic factors) to the dependent variables (online course completion 
and non-completion) different bivariate statistical methods were employed ( Table 2 ). For 
scaled data, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing the mean scores for each 
of the ESPRI-V2 and DSL cognitive factors to the dependent variable were used. For the 
categorical data (i.e., student demographic and environmental factors), a Pearson’s Chi- 
Square test was performed.

study, a significant difference was found between completers and non-completers on 
achievement beliefs and organization, with completers rating themselves higher in each

Goad - 2020 - Predicting Student Success in Online Physical Education.pdf,"beliefs and organization skills, while creating an obstacle for those students who do not. 
This could be especially true if those students adhered to the common misconceptions 
that online courses are not as rigorous as face-to-face courses and take less time to 
complete (Williams, 2015 ).
Class standing was also found to be significantly different between completers and non- 
completers. OLPE students were over two times more likely to complete the course if they 
entered the course as a sophomore, junior or senior. Mosier’s ( 2010 ) study examining high 
school students enrolled in online HRF courses within the Florida Virtual Schools found 
similar, statistically significant results regarding class standing and course completion. 
Specifically, Moiser found that 59% of seniors (n = 5,512) completed the online HRF course 
in comparison to 44% of freshman (n = 704) students (2010). Moiser speculated that 
a student’s proximity to graduation might contribute to the differences observed in course 
completion rates; that is, upper-level students could have been more motivated to enroll in 
the online course to fulfill graduation requirements while underclassmen could have chosen 
the course based on personal preferences (Mosier, 2010 ).
Additionally, in the current study the influence of class standing in course completion 
could have been attributed to a student’s lack of prior exposure and use of the institutions’ 
LMS, Wellness Dashboard, and fitness tracker used within the OLPE course. Because the 
data were gathered in the Fall 2017 means that enrolled freshmen could have been 
interacting with the specific software and hardware required for the OLPE course for 
the first time. It stands to reason that tapping into student’s previous experience with 
course-specific software and hardware is worth exploring due to freshman completion 
rates being significantly different from upperclassmen. It is possible that freshman in this 
study did not have previous experience navigating the specific software and hardware 
employed by the OLPE course which could have attributed to the discrepancies between 
class standing and course completion, as opposed to their general experience with online 
courses alone.
Findings related to cognitive characteristics appear to support this notion as well. 
Contrary to previous research (Hayatt, 2015 ; Osborn, 2001 ; Rankin, 2013 ; Roblyer, 
Blomeyer & Rankin-Reed, 2006 ; Roblyer et al., 2008 ), this study found no significant 
difference between completers’ and non-completers’ instructional risk-taking and technol -
ogy skills/self-efficacy. Specifically, in the field of OLPE students’ difficulty navigating 
technology has often been cited as a negative contributing factor (Brewer, 2001 ; Futrell, 
2009 ; Goc Karp & Woods, 2003 ; Kane, 2004 ). Daum and Buschner ( 2014 ) point out, “It is

In the current study, both completers and non-completers rated themselves highly in 
technology skill/ability. Instructors of online HRF courses are now teaching a generation of

( 2016 ) descriptive overview of an OLPE course in Georgia found that over 90% of students 
surveyed indicated they knew how to use the Internet, audio, video, presentation, and word 
processing software. However, personal technology use does not equate to a student’s ability 
to use technology for learning. Similar thoughts have been expressed by PETE instructors in

This could be especially true if those students adhered to the common misconceptions 
that online courses are not as rigorous as face-to-face courses and take less time to 
complete.
Class standing was also found to be significantly different between completers and non- 
completers. OLPE students were over two times more likely to complete the course if they 
entered the course as a sophomore, junior or senior. Mosier’s study examining high 
school students enrolled in online HRF courses within the Florida Virtual Schools found 
similar, statistically significant results regarding class standing and course completion. 
Specifically, Moiser found that 59% of seniors (n = 5,512) completed the online HRF course 
in comparison to 44% of freshman (n = 704) students (2010). Moiser speculated that 
a student’s proximity to graduation might contribute to the differences observed in course 
completion rates; that is, upper-level students could have been more motivated to enroll in 
the online course to fulfill graduation requirements while underclassmen could have chosen 
the course based on personal preferences.
Additionally, in the current study the influence of class standing in course completion 
could have been attributed to a student’s lack of prior exposure and use of the institutions’ 
LMS, Wellness Dashboard, and fitness tracker used within the OLPE course. Because the 
data were gathered in the Fall 2017 means that enrolled freshmen could have been 
interacting with the specific software and hardware required for the OLPE course for 
the first time. It stands to reason that tapping into student’s previous experience with 
course-specific software and hardware is worth exploring due to freshman completion 
rates being significantly different from upperclassmen. It is possible that freshman in this 
study did not have previous experience navigating the specific software and hardware 
employed by the OLPE course which could have attributed to the discrepancies between 
class standing and course completion, as opposed to their general experience with online 
courses alone.
Findings related to cognitive characteristics appear to support this notion as well. 
Contrary to previous research , this study found no significant 
difference between completers’ and non-completers’ instructional risk-taking and technol -
ogy skills/self-efficacy. Specifically, in the field of OLPE students’ difficulty navigating 
technology has often been cited as a negative contributing factor. Daum and Buschner point out, “It is 
easy to wonder how many of the issues the teacher and students faced in [Goc] Karp and 
Woods and Kane’s studies were due to the technology of the time . . . ” (p.

technology self-efficacy/skills screening questions to reflect the specific hardware and soft -

general proficiencies.
Learning environment
The design of learning environments within online courses has been found to influence 
student success (Rice, 2006 ). Hilgart et al. ( 2012 ) define the learning environment as the 
context in which the instruction will take place, specifically focusing on three domains – 
physical, social, and institutional. The physical domain refers to the environment where the 
learner will complete tasks; the social reflects interactions with others, such as peers and 
influential networks (e.g. family, friends, employer, etc.); and institutional considerations 
relate to the goals and views held by the organization offering the course. Researchers posit 
that by examining these three environmental domains, one can construct a snapshot of how 
a student’s willingness and ability to persist through an online course is influenced (Hilgart 
et al., 2012 ). The physical components of an online course such as appearance, content 
delivery, student use, and support have the potential to be responsive to student and 
environmental characteristics (Ritterband et al., 2009 ). Ritterband et al. ( 2009 ) describe 
user characteristics (i.e. gender, age, ethnicity, etc.) as fixed, however, influenced by 
environmental and societal-level factors including but not limited to friends and family, 
finances, employer, school, social media, policy, cultural norms, etc. These environmental 
factors have been seen to affect student website use and persistence through online courses 
(Hart, 2012 ; Ivankova & Stick, 2005 ; Osborn, 2001 ; Xu & Jaggers, 2014 ). To better under -
stand the impact of these variables on enrolled students, needs assessments can inform 
online course designers and instructors in selecting relevant motivation, learning, and 
instructional theories to leverage environmental factors to meet course objectives.
Contrary to previous online student success research, the current study found no 
significant difference between completers and non-completers regarding course load, type 
of student, and financial dependents/aid/stability (Hart, 2012 ; Ivankova & Stick, 2005 ; 
Osborn, 2001 ; Xu & Jaggars, 2014 ). However, a significant difference between completers 
and non-completers was reported for hours worked outside of school. Students who worked 
20 hours or less outside of school were nearly two times more likely to complete to course. 
Hart ( 2012 ) referred to factors such as hours worked outside of school (HWOS) as “non- 
academic issues” that present unique barriers to student success. For example, Shin and 
Kim ( 1999 ) examined the relationship among learner background characteristics 
and course success through a path analysis that revealed an interrelationship among GPA 
and job load (i.e. HWOS). Demonstrating how “non-academic issues” can affect a student’s 
academic performance. Additionally, research has found statistically significant differences 
in the amount of time spent engaged in course activities (e.g. time spent viewing content, 
reading/responding to posts, etc.) between completers and non-completers of online 
courses (Foon Hew, 2016 ; Hart, 2012 ; Shelton, Hung, & Lowenthal, 2017 ). In the current 
study, it is possible that the amount of HWOS affected some student’s ability to access and 
actively engaged in course content.

When applying the IDT Behavior Change Framework, Hilgart et al. ( 2012 ) describe the 
Analysis Phase as finding the gaps between “what is” and “what should be.” The use of the 
ESPRI-V2 (Roblyer et al., 2008 ) and DLS (Osborn, 2001 ) in the current study, served to 
analyze the possible gaps between students who persisted to complete the online PE 
course and those who did not. By identifying the gaps between ideal performance and 
reality, the causes of those gaps can begin to be quantified. The results of the study 
revealed that upon course entry, students who did not complete the course generally 
reported a combination of the following factors: GPA below 2.6, worked more than 
20 hours outside of school, freshmen in class standing, and perceived themselves to 
possess weak organizational beliefs.
Given the results of previous research possible remediation strategies for students who fit 
the above profile could benefit from early identification and pre-course orientation mod -
ules. Roblyer, Blomeyer and Rankin-Reed ( 2006 ) suggest pre-course orientation sessions for 
students that focus on goal-orientation and self-management strategies. Ideally, pre-course 
orientations that utilize stories or scenarios that illustrate subject matter content and are 
designed with scaffolded learning opportunities encouraging goal setting, planning, and 
reflection (Roblyer et al., 2006 ). The objectives of these pre-course intervention strategies 
align with findings from research examining self-regulated learning strategies on online 
student success (Broadbent, 2017 ; Hart, 2012 ; Hyatt, 2015 ). Broadbent ( 2017 ) found that 
time management and effort regulation strategies emphasizing scheduling, planning, self- 
management, and effort during study time were found to positively influence online student 
grades. This aligns with Hyatt’s ( 2015 ) findings that suggest successful students reported the 
use of self-awareness, self-efficacy, and goal setting strategies to stay motivated throughout 
online courses. For example, teaching students to use an agenda for weekly planning, 
prioritizing tasks, and creating short, medium, and long-term plans could foster self- 
management skills in at-risk students.
Non-academic issues should also be considered in designing support strategies for online 
students. Research has shown a significant difference between completers and non- 
completers of online course in the amount of time spent engaged in course activities 
(Foon Hew, 2016 ; Hart, 2012 ; Shelton et al., 2017 ). To encourage students to engage 
more frequently with online course materials and peers, it has been suggested that, when 
possible, course content be made personally relevant and easily accessible to students (Foon 
Hew, 2016 ; Shelton et al., 2017 ). For students who work more than 20 hours outside of 
school, mobile learning strategies could make the course more accessible, meet the demands 
of their schedule, and provide individualized content.
While previous success and retention studies have focused on the influences of non- 
malleable traits such as demographics and cognitive style, Roblyer et al. ( 2008 ) and Osborn’s

some of which could be modified with pre-course orientation and course design/delivery 
methods. Findings from previous studies indicate that a combination of student factors and

probably be much easier than predicting failure. Results from the current study provide

development of programs to support student success in online HRF courses.
Limitations
Limitations of this study included student self-reporting procedures and the generalizability 
of results. Discipline-specific factors related to online student motivation to exercise were 
incomplete due to the distribution of surveys at the midterm. Many non-completers who 
filled out the pre-course ESPRI-V2 and DSL surveys did not complete the midterm survey, 
diluting the sample size. Group size relations between completers and non-completers 
affected the variability between some environmental and demographic categorical data, 
which may have contributed to not finding a significant relationship between variables 
when statistical methods were applied. This affected the study’s ability to find meaningful 
significant relationships between completers and non-completers. For example, of the 821 
students who completed the survey only 16 reported no prior online course experience. 
Additionally, the pass rate was 77.47% with 185 students not completing the online HRF 
course. It is possible that this level of group variability increased the probability of a Type II 
error for factors that indicated no level of significance due to a low number of non- 
completers results.
Lastly, results from the study are not generalizable to other OLPE courses due to the 
unique context of the university programs. It seems likely that a set of factors specific to an 
institution’s population must be generated to calculate meaningful probability of passing 
scores for online students. However, the use of the screening instruments used in the 
current study can be replicated at another site to identify relevant student demographic 
and environmental factors.
Future directions
There is considerable diversity in online student success literature about the factors 
influencing student completion and non-completion (Alem et al., 2014 ; Hart, 2012 ). 
Studies have shown that factors included in the ESPRI-V2 and DSL play a role in 
identifying successful and unsuccessful students. However, no one set of characteristics 
or factors have emerged as dominant due to a lack of replication studies, measurement of 
different student populations, and disciplines. The focus of future research should exam -
ine the application and impact intervention strategies have in relation to supporting 
student success.
While it is beyond the scope of the current study to determine at what point the non- 
completing students withdrew from the course, future research should consider when 
student dropout occurs. Research has shown that students who withdraw tend to disen -
gage from online courses within the first few weeks, usually before the first exam is 
scheduled or major assignment due (Murphy & Stewart, 2017 ; Simpson, 2013 ). 
Additionally, research has found significant differences in the amount of time spent
