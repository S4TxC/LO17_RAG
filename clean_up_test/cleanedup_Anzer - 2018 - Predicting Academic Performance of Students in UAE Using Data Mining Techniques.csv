Abstract—In this paper, we implemented an approach to 
predict final exam scores from early course assessments of the 
students during the semester. We used a linear regression model 
to check which part of the evaluation of the course assessment 
affects final exam score the most. In addition, we explained the 
origins of data mining and data mining in education. After 
preprocessing and preparing data for the task in hand, we 
implemented the linear regression model. The results of our work 
show that quizzes are most accurate predictors of final exam 
scores compared to other kinds of assessments.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
The main objective of academic institutes is to offer quality 
education to their students. One of the important measure of 
quality education is students’ academic performance. 
Identifying factors that affect the academic performance of 
students is of utmost priority for any academic organization.  
Data mining is an analytical process that explores large data 
sets to establish relationships and identify patterns to find 
solutions for problems using data analysis. The tools of data 
mining allow enterprises to have predictions for future trends in 
the market. Predictive analytics is a common type of data 
mining which is widely used by organizations to make better 
business decisions [1]. The data mining process is made up of 
several steps as follows: data collection, pre-processing data, 
applying data mining, interpretation, evaluation, and deploying 
the results.  
Data mining tools can be used in many applications. We 
decided to use data mining tools for Educational Data Mining 
(EDM). EDM is a developing discipline involved in 
establishing methods and approaches to have a better 
understanding of students and the learning setting they are in. It 
is used to explore the distinctive large-scale data which is 
growing rapidly. The data usually has a meaningful hierarchy, 
which needs to be decided by the data properties. Matters like 
sequence, time, and context have a significant role in 
educational data study [2].  
The objective of this study is to predict students’ 
performance in the final exam using their previous grades 
during the semester and see how accurate the model’s 
predicted results are compared to the real results. To achieve 
this objective, we used students’ data at Abu Dhabi University. 
To make predictions we opted to use linear regression as this is 
a commonly used data mining technique to predict continuous 
values. 
We noticed some studies about the prediction of academic 
performance of students in multiple universities using different 
analysis tools, so we wanted to conduct our study based on the 
tools we see are suitable to give better results. The study is very 
much important, as the previous studies have provided with 
limited knowledge about the prediction of the academic 
performances. The academic performance is prioritized in this 
research for the development of knowledge about the students 
in UAE. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
discusses the previous work done by other researchers in the 
same field. Section III discusses the steps of data mining 
process used to carry out the research such as data collection, 
pre-processing, modeling, and evaluating. Section IV discusses 
the results and limitation of our work. Finally, Section V 
concludes our work and the results.

in a higher success rate. Also, they indicated that assignments 
have negative effect on academic performance. Their study 
also reveals that students' attendance plays an essential role in

Merchan et al. analyzed the records of 932 students of systems engineering from El Bosque University to build a"
Anzer - 2018 - Predicting Academic Performance of Students in UAE Using Data Mining Techniques.pdf,"predictive model for students based on their academic 
performance. Data obtained is evaluated based on predicted 
input, data output, output depiction, theory, and model which 
are relevant for prediction accuracy. The results obtained 
depicts the performance of students through their learning 
process. Based on results, timely decision can be made to 
prevent academic risk [5]. 
It has been observed in Malaysia by Amirah et al. [6] that 
their existing system lacks to analyze and monitor student 
performance due to insufficient prediction method and lack of 
investigation on aspects which affect students' 
accomplishments. Consequently, a thorough literature review 
to predict student progress with different data mining 
techniques is proposed to enhance student achievements. 
Various data mining techniques used are Decision Tree, Neural 
Network, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support 
Vector Machine. The main objective was to stipulate a 
synopsis of data mining techniques that are used by other 
researchers to forecast students' performance. Also, to focus on 
how prediction algorithms could be exploited to distinguish 
utmost vital attributes in a student's data. Students 
achievements and success can be enhanced more efficiently by 
using educational data mining techniques. It will benefit 
educational institute, educators, and students. As a result, it has 
been observed that Neural Network has the highest accuracy of 
98%, Decision Tress has 91%, K-Nearest Neighbor has 83%, 
and Naive Bayes has the lowest accuracy of 76% [6].  
Pooja et al. [7] provided a comprehensive survey of 
educations data mining done from the year 2002 to 2014 and 
its scope in the future. It has been noticed that extensive work 
is done for the usage of data mining techniques in education 
but still some areas are untouched and unified approach is not 
used. The previous work done in this area include student's 
course satisfaction, finding a set of weak students, faculty 
evaluations, predicting student drop out, course registration 
planning, etc. Other researchers came up with a significant 
relationship between employability and personality preferences 
such as work and life experience. This relationship is an 
important aspect of Employability Development Profile. 
Hence, employability is bound to dispositions and 
competencies instead of academic qualification [7].  
Educational data mining is considered as developing a 
method to explore unique kinds of data related to educational 
context. In e-learning system, application of data mining is an 
iterative cycle. Romero et al. [8] provided a survey for some 
applications of data mining in learning management system 
and Moodle system, which is mostly used by universities 
worldwide. Their objective was to provide both theoretically 
and practically for all users related to such systems as e-
learning administrators, online instructors, etc. This Moodle 
data mining tool will be used by online instructors by 
precluding the requirement for CMS administrators to pre-
process data and apply data mining techniques. It will 
automatically pre-process Moodle data and simplify it to 
configure and execute data mining techniques through its data 
mining algorithms. The complete process of data mining for e-
learning data is systematically described and how data mining 
techniques can be used for Moodle data like visualization, 
statistics, clustering, classification, and association rule. They 
used Weka and Keel systems which are free data mining tools 
to make it easier for any user to apply data mining without 
purchasing a commercial tool [8]. 
III. P
ROCESS OF DATA MINING IN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE 
This section includes steps used to carry out the data 
mining task in hand.  
A. Collect Data 
Data has been collected from Abu Dhabi University during 
the past four years from 2014 till 2017. The data gathered 
pertains to a computer programming course. This data has been 
provided based on years and gender on separate sheets as this 
course is taught separately to male and female students. These 
sheets comprise of different attributes like gender, quiz 1, quiz 
2, quiz 3, quiz 4, assignment 1, assignment 2, assignment 3, 
midterm, and final exam grades. Each sheet comprised of a 
different number of records. All the sheets data was combined 
giving us a total of 182 examples including both genders.  
B. Pre-Process The Data  
After accessing the data, we preprocessed the data by 
modifying it to make all the quiz grades with the same weight, 
as well as the assignment. We aggregated the marks of all 
quizzes and all assignments to know the total quizzes and the 
total assignments grades. We also removed unneeded attributes 
and modified the missing values of the quizzes by adding the 
average of the other quizzes to the missing values and 
converted the final exam grade to a percentage. We also 
removed quiz 4 as in some semesters, quiz 4 was not been 
conducted. We applied data mining on 182 examples with 12 
regular attributes. We decided to make the final exam grade as 
a special attribute/label, as this is the attribute we wanted to 
predict from the other attributes. We also wanted to know 
which of the other attributes contribute more in accurately 
predicting the final exam grade. 
C. Apply Data Mining  
Linear regression is used to predict an academic 
performance of a student in course assessments of a 
programming course. The purpose of using linear regression is 
that it is used to predict numeric and continuous values 
whereas other techniques like classification use discrete values. 
It is used to indicate the significant relationships between 
independent and dependent variables and their strength of 
impact. Whereas in our scenario, it is a relationship between 
attributes of course assessments and final exams.  
We used the Rapid Miner tool to implement linear 
regression. The reason we chose to use this tool are [9]: 
• Maximizes data productivity. 
• Access data of any format. 
• Robust statistical overview to explore and 
understand data quickly using graphical displays 
like scatter, histogram charts, etc.

transformation tools. 
• Provides different models like classification, 
regression, clustering etc. along with multiple 
operators. 
• Offers different validation techniques and 
performance evaluation. 
D. Interpret, Evaluate And Deploy The Results 
 
Rapid Miner is used to import data from an excel sheet. The 
needed attributes are selected to perform the linear regression. 
The attribute of gender is converted to numerical to avoid error 
while applying regression. Final exam is selected as the label 
by using the Set Role operator. Linear regressions are applied 
inside the Cross-Validation operator as shown in Fig. 1 and 
Fig. 2. 
The equation used to perform linear regression is: 
Y= B
0 + B1x1 + B2x2 +…+ B nxn + ε 
where x1, x2, …x n are dependent variables, B1, B2, …B n are 
coefficients of regression, B 0 is the y-intercept,  ε  is the 
residual (difference between actual and predicted values), and 
Y is the label value (the value to be predicted). 
 
 
Fig. 1. Design of Model on Rapid Miner 
 
Fig. 2. Cross-validation of data set 
 
In TABLE I, it is seen that there are multiple attributes, the 
coefficient represents the coefficient of the equation to get the 
results using each attribute. The standard error is the sampling 
error estimate, and it is to estimate the variation under the 
repeated sampling. As for the standardized coefficient, it is the 
estimate which results from the analysis of the regression, and 
it was standardized to make the variances of both independent 
and dependent variables become 1. For the tolerance, it means 
that it is the ability of the algorithm to learn when the data 
given is corrupted. The t-stat is the value coming from dividing 
the coefficient by the standard error. Therefore, the higher the 
absolute value of the attribute is, the better it is for the 
regression. The p-value is calculated from the t-stat, and it is 
the probability of having a result, which is the like the one we 
have in a random data collection. The code shows which 
attributes affect the regression the most. We see that we have 
different values to represent to know which attributes affect the 
value of the final exam. The attribute column shows which 
attribute in the excel sheet has more impact on the grade, and 
the one having more stars has more effect. It is seen that the 
Total quiz attribute has three stars, and total assignment 
attribute has two stars, which means that the total quiz has the 
most effect on the final exam. In the results, we can find t-stat, 
and p-value. These two values show how we pick the attributes 
with the most effect. As we explained earlier, the t-stat is the 
value coming from dividing the coefficient by the standard 
error. Therefore, the higher the absolute value of the attribute 
is, the better it is for the regression. The p-value is calculated 
from the t-stat, and it is the probability of having a result, 
which is like the one we have in a random data collection. It 
means that the lower the value of the p-value, the better it is, 
and the ones with the highest absolute value of t-stat, and the 
lowest value of the p-value, are the Total quiz, and the Total 
assignment value. According to the values, it can be noticed 
that the gender does not have any significance on the 
regression, so it is decided to run a test on the data after 
removing the attribute of the gender to show more realistic 
values. In this model, the squared correlation is 0.396, which is 
almost 0.4. Squared correlation is always between 0 and 1, and 
the closer it is to 1, the better it is. The values are not highly 
correlated according to this result.

showing that the Total assignment and the Total quiz attributes 
have the same effect on the final exam. The values of t-stat 
should be higher, and p-value should be lower. Therefore, it 
can be concluded that after running all the data we notice that 
the Total quiz and the Total assignment affect the marks of the 
final exam the most. In this model, a squared correlation is of

one, and it gives a similar result that the values are not highly

In TABLE III, attributes considered are, quiz 1, quiz 2, quiz 
3, total assignment, mid-term, and final exam. It has been 
noticed that total assignment and quiz 2 has more impact on the 
final exam as it consists of 3 stars. Based on these attributes, 
we can compute the values of t-stat and p-value. The highest 
absolute value of t-stat are a total assignment and quiz two 
whereas lowest values of the p-value are a Total assignment 
and quiz 2. Hence, it has been concluded that total assignment 
and quiz 2 has more impact on a final exam, which means if a 
student did well in assignment there are more chances for them 
to get a good mark in their final. According to the values quiz 3 
has no importance in regression, so this attribute can be 
excluded from the data to run a test.  In this model, we got a 
squared correlation of 0.391. The values are not highly 
correlated according to this result.

In TABLE IV, quiz is contributing the most to the final exam 
marks. Therefore, after removing the gender, the total 
assignment, and the total quiz, these results are achieved. 
According to the code attribute, the quizzes contributing the 
most to the final exam marks are quiz 1 and quiz 2 equally. 
Quiz 1, and quiz 2 have the highest t-stat values, which are 
2.89, and 3.34 respectively. Also, quiz 1, and quiz 2 have the 
lowest p-value, which is 0.004, and 0.001 respectively. As for 
quiz 3, it has less contribution to the final exam marks. For this 
model, a squared correlation is of 0.352, which is the lowest 
correlation among all the models we created, but it is still in the 
range of 0.3.

IV. DISCUSSION 
In this paper, multiple linear regression method is used for 
the evaluation of earlier course assessments of how they affect 
the final examination score. Apart from that, this article has 
also provided knowledge about the process of using data 
mining in academic assessments. The use of linear regression 
model can also be witnessed in this article as it reveals the 
knowledge about the quizzes as the most important predictor of 
the final examination score. Apart from that, the results are 
accomplished after the eradication of gender criteria from the 
entire process of research. The results showed that Quiz 1 and 
Quiz 2 are equally important with highest rating of the t values 
whereas these quizzes are the lowest conceiver of the p values. 
The result of Quiz 3 has comparatively lower attributes of 
contribution of the final examination scores.  
A limitation of the study is that it was conducted on the 
academic performance of the students in a programming 
course. The results may vary in non-programming courses. 
Educational  institutes can use the process of data mining to 
procure effective knowledge of the academic predictions about 
the examination results of the students. This will help in raising 
students retention as bad academic performance is a leading 
reason for many students who do not complete their planned 
course of studies. The future studies ought to incorporate 
adequate time to make extensive research using greater sample 
size to generate more general results for the analysis. In the 
future, we are considering conducting the study on both 
programming and non-programming-oriented courses to get 
better prediction for the results, and a better regression model 
for the relationships between the attributes used.

showing that the Total assignment and the Total quiz attributes 
have the same effect on the final exam. The values of t-stat

can be concluded that after running all the data we notice that 
the Total quiz and the Total assignment affect the marks of the 
final exam the most. In this model, a squared correlation is of 
0.364, and this correlation is slightly lower than the previous

Anzer - 2018 - Predicting Academic Performance of Students in UAE Using Data Mining Techniques.pdf,"V. CONCLUSION 
Academic data mining is considered as an emerging field 
related to developing different ways to explore the distinct type 
of data derived from educational context. Predicting 
performance of students can become difficult due to the large 
volume of educational data. In this paper, we elaborated how 
the application of data mining techniques can be useful to 
predict factors which will have more effect on marks of the 
final exam. Through this prediction, it will be easier for 
educators and students to improve their learning and teaching 
processes by knowing which attribute contribute more to 
achieve good grades. This paper reviewed historic data related 
to programming course to predict student performance. To 
carry out data mining, we used linear regression as our data 
was numeric. We experiment with selecting and avoiding some 
attributes of the same data set. Through results achieved, it can 
be concluded that total assignment and quizzes have more 
impact on the final exam. If a student does well in these 
factors, they can achieve good marks in the final exam.
