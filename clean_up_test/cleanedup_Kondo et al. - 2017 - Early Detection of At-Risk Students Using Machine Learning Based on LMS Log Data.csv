Abstract— Analytics in education has been received much 
attention over the past decade. It is necessary to maintain high 
retention rate in any institutions of higher education, therefore 
several attempts on the application of analytics have been done 
for this problem. To detect students at high drop-out risk early 
and intervene them effectively, utilizing the educational big data 
can be useful. In this paper, an automatic detection method of 
academically at-risk students by using log data of learning 
management systems is considered. Some well-known machine 
learning methods are used to build a predictive model of student 
performance evaluated by GPA. By using actual data set, we 
investigate an availability of the proposed method and discuss its 
ability to early detection of off-task behavior. The experimental 
results indicated that some characteristics of behavior about 
learning which affect the learning outcomes can be detected with 
only the online log data. Furthermore, comparative importance 
of explanatory variables obtained by the approach would help to 
estimate which variable affects comparatively to the learning 
outcome and it can be used in institutional research.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Over the last decade, the word of “big data” has emerged 
and it has been used widely in many areas, such as marketing 
research, health care services, business, social media analysis, 
medicine development, and so on. Using “big data”, making an 
adequate decision, finding useful patterns or rule set, fault or 
change detection and chance discovery are tried with some 
statistical techniques.  
Analytics of big data in education has been studied actively 
from approximately 2000. Particularly, learning analytics has 
been one of the major field of the research on analytics in 
education. Learning analytics was defined as follows [1]: 
Learning analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and 
reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for 
purposes of understanding and optimising learning and the 
environments in which it occurs. 
A concept of academic analytics has been also proposed in 
late 2000s from the viewpoint of an application of analytics in 
the level of institution or politics [2]. In academic analytics, 
quality assurance of education or accountability of university 
are rather focused than the learning or teaching perspective, 
thus learning outcomes or retention of students are targets of 
analytics. Academic analytics has a close relationship with the 
viewpoint of enrollment management in institutional research 
(IR). For educational institutions, especially colleges or 
universities, it is necessary that high retention rate is 
maintained, therefore enrollment management is important. 
In recent studies, for example, early detection of at-risk 
students with learning analytics has been considered in this 
context [3]. In order to detect students who have high drop-out 
risk early and intervene them effectively, utilizing the 
educational big data can be useful. Several studies also 
investigated the correlation between learning outcome and 
usage of learning management system (LMS) [4], and the log 
data of LMS have turned to be useful to analyze students’ 
learning behavior. 
In this study, an approach to detection of academically at-
risk students by using machine learning methods based on log 
data of learning management system is proposed. Then results 
of some numerical experiments with actual data implemented 
to investigate the performance of the approach will be shown.

XPERIMENTAL DATA 
In this study, students’ data of a university, called 
“university X” in this paper, are used. The university X is a 
private liberal arts university in Japan. The used data are 
records of 202 students admitted to the department Y of the 
university X in 2015. 
In the university X, a LMS is used on the whole university. 
Students should use the LMS to manage their own learning in 
several classes, to check some information from the 
university, to use an e-portfolio system, to learn with some 
self-learning contents, and so on. They are expected to use the 
LMS enough throughout their school life. The LMS records a 
logfile whenever any students operate it. One record contains 
the student ID, the operating date and the type of operation. 
Although the LMS is not very often used in some classes, a 
level of usage is expected to reflect a level of commitment to

to spend their school life smoothly. 
In the experiment, all logfiles of a period between April 
1st and August 5th in 2015 were used. The number of record 
was 200,979. Each record contains the type of operation. For 
example, the operation types are to log-in, or log-out, to boot 
the player of e-learning, to start or end the lesson, to submit an 
assignment, and so on. In this study, some features were 
extracted from the LMS log data. These features and the rate 
of attendance of offline compulsory classes in the first 
semester were used as the explanatory variables, and then the 
problem of predicting a GPA of the first semester was 
considered. 
The explanatory variables used in this study are shown in 
Table I. “(1) GPA” is a binary variable. Let μ be the mean and 
let σ be the standard deviation of GPA of all students, “(1) 
GPA” of a certain student is to be 1 when the GPA of him/her 
is greater than  μ − σ, or it is to be 0 otherwise. “(1) GPA” = 0 
means the student has been off-task and he/she is 
academically at-risk. Seven types of explanatory variables 
were considered as shown in Table I. “(2) Attendance rate” is 
the rate of attendance of offline compulsory classes in the first 
semester. (3)-(8) are the variables extracted from the LMS log 
data. These variables express several perspectives of student’s 
action on the LMS. “(3) # of booting the player” refers to the 
total number of booting the player of any e-learning contents. 
“(4) Night Act” is the total number of operation during the 
night (0 a.m. to 5 a.m.). “(5) # of logging-in” is the total 
number of logging in the LMS. “(6) # of starting a lesson” is 
the total number of booting a function for an output of 
learning, and “(7) # of submission completion” refers to 
complete such an output activity. “(8) Duration of logging-in 
time” is the estimated value of the total duration of logging in 
the LMS. 
III. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS 
A. Predictive modeling with machine learning 
Machine learning is the approach to give computers the 
ability to learn automatically like human beings. The machine 
learning methods have some sort of algorithms that discover 
patterns or rules from actual data, and the model learned 
appropriately can predict unseen data properly. The methods 
are often used in several fields such as pattern recognition, 
medical diagnostics, search engine, robotics, and so on. In the 
fields of analytics in education, the machine learning methods 
are frequently used for the construction of predictive model of 
learners. In this study, we used well-known machine learning 
methods [5], which are logistic regression, support vector 
machine and random forest, to predict the GPA by the 
explanatory variables shown in Table I.  
Logistic regression is a kind of generalized linear model 
and used often as two class classifier. Due to its easiness to 
handle and applicability, it has been used in several fields. 
Support vector machine (SVM) is a kernel machine widely 
used for pattern classification and regression problem. As it is 
said that SVM has high generalization ability, it has been used 
widely as well as the logistic regression. Random forest is one

of the ensemble learning model. The random forest model 
contains some simple decision trees as weak learners and 
output the value as the average or majority vote of outputs of 
the decision trees. It is known that the random forest model has 
some advantage such as robustness against the noise, quickness 
of learning, easiness of setting the hyper parameter, and so on. 
The numerical experiments were implemented by Python 
3.6.0 and scikit-learn package were used for the construction of 
the predictive models with machine learning methods. 
B. Early detection of at-risk students 
From the purpose of this study, an at-risk student detecting 
method should have an ability to detect such students as early 
as possible. Therefore, we performed an experiment to 
investigate how the detection ability changes for each week in 
the first semester. The period of classes per a semester of the 
target university is 15 weeks. In this experiment, the 
classification metrics for each week were calculated with all 
data obtained by each week. We used common metrics such as 
precision, recall, and F-measure. 10-fold cross validation was 
implemented for 10 times and each metric was averaged. 
A weekly change of the classification metric values for 
three machine learning methods are shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 6. 
Week “0” is the week when a series of orientation for freshmen 
is implemented. Fig. 1 to Fig. 3 show the case of the “(2) 
Attendance rate” included, and Fig. 4 to Fig. 6 show the results 
without the “(2) Attendance rate”.  
In latter part of the period, the detection ability of the 
logistic regression model was relatively higher than the other 
models. On the other hand, the random forest model can detect 
more at-risk students at the early stage, especially until the 
third week. Moreover, the random forest model seems to have 
the most stable behavior and good valance of precision and 
recall. The SVM model had high precision values, but had low 
recall values comparatively. 
Although the detection performances in the case of not 
using “(2) Attendance rate” were lower than in the case of 
using it, the random forest model relatively performed well 
with only the LMS log data. As shown in Fig. 6, the recall at 
week 0 was about 0.3 and the recall at week 3 was about 0.4. 
Therefore, the random forest model can detect about 30 % of 
at-risk students until the first week, and can detect about 40 % 
of at-risk students until the fourth week.

C. Weekly change of comparative importance of variables 
It would be preferable to investigate which variable affect 
the classification ability strongly. As the random forest model 
can calculate comparative importance of variables based on 
Gini index, we investigated weekly change of the importance 
of variables as an approach to deal with such a problem. 
The comparative importance of variables for each week are 
shown in Fig. 7 and Fig.8. These figures are corresponding to 
Fig. 3 and Fig. 6 respectively. Though a ratio of importance 
changed in any given week, the “(2) Attendance rate” variable 
was the most important for every weeks excluding the 
orientation week in the case of using the “(2) Attendance rate”. 
In another case of not using the “(2) Attendance rate”, it seems 
that some timings of relatively meaningful change 
corresponded to the timings of change of the classification 
metric values. For example, during weeks 0 to 3, the number of 
logging-in was becoming more important, and the 
classification metric values were also becoming higher. At 
week 10, the classification metric values sharply became 
higher, and the importance of the logging time also became 
higher and the duration of logging in became lower. This 
phenomenon indicates that the important activities can be 
inferred by carefully watching the weekly change of the 
comparative importance of variables, and it helps us assess the 
curriculum and student support strategy from the perspective of 
institutional research. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this study, we considered automatic detecting method for 
at-riskstudents. We examined the typical machine learning 
techniques to such students based on the actual log data of 
LMS and investigated their performance. 
The random forest model showed the most stable behavior 
and good valance of precision and recall. The model can detect 
about 40 % of at-risk students at the end of third week of first 
semester with only the LMS log data. As the approach can 
detect a sign of off-task behavior of students with only the log 
data which are to be stored automatically to the LMS, a certain 
level of applicability of the approach is shown. It is indicated 
that some characteristics of behavior about learning which 
affect the learning outcomes can be detected with only the 
online log data. 
Furthermore, ranking of comparative importance of 
explanatory variables obtained by the approach would help to 
estimate which variable affects comparatively to the learning 
outcome at any given point of time. By watching the 
importance of variable constantly, it is expected that an 
intervention strategy will be more adaptively and planning of 
classes, curriculum and student support can be considered 
based on the information.

It would be preferable to investigate which variable affect 
the classification ability strongly. As the random forest model 
can calculate comparative importance of variables based on 
Gini index, we investigated weekly change of the importance 
of variables as an approach to deal with such a problem. 
The comparative importance of variables for each week are 
shown in Fig. 7 and Fig.8. These figures are corresponding to 
Fig. 3 and Fig. 6 respectively. Though a ratio of importance 
changed in any given week, the “(2) Attendance rate” variable 
was the most important for every weeks excluding the 
orientation week in the case of using the “(2) Attendance rate”. 
In another case of not using the “(2) Attendance rate”, it seems 
that some timings of relatively meaningful change 
corresponded to the timings of change of the classification 
metric values. For example, during weeks 0 to 3, the number of 
logging-in was becoming more important, and the 
classification metric values were also becoming higher. At 
week 10, the classification metric values sharply became 
higher, and the importance of the logging time also became 
higher and the duration of logging in became lower. This 
phenomenon indicates that the important activities can be 
inferred by carefully watching the weekly change of the 
comparative importance of variables, and it helps us assess the 
curriculum and student support strategy from the perspective of 
institutional research. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this study, we considered automatic detecting method for 
at-riskstudents. We examined the typical machine learning 
techniques to such students based on the actual log data of 
LMS and investigated their performance. 
The random forest model showed the most stable behavior 
and good valance of precision and recall. The model can detect 
about 40 % of at-risk students at the end of third week of first 
semester with only the LMS log data. As the approach can 
detect a sign of off-task behavior of students with only the log 
data which are to be stored automatically to the LMS, a certain 
level of applicability of the approach is shown. It is indicated 
that some characteristics of behavior about learning which 
affect the learning outcomes can be detected with only the 
online log data. 
Furthermore, ranking of comparative importance of 
explanatory variables obtained by the approach would help to 
estimate which variable affects comparatively to the learning 
outcome at any given point of time. By watching the 
importance of variable constantly, it is expected that an 
intervention strategy will be more adaptively and planning of 
classes, curriculum and student support can be considered 
based on the information."
