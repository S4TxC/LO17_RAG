Abstract—Identification of factors affecting the success 
performance of students is an issue which has been studied 
extensively. In this study, the predicting and analyzing of student 
success in secondary school was conducted using data mining 
algorithms. Main subject targeted in this study is exploring the 
factors that affect student success significantly. For this purpose, 
determination of the factors which affect students’ performance 
more is targeted with using feature selection algorithms. In the 
classification stage, four classification algorithms have been used. 
Data set consists of data collected from two public schools in the 
Alentejo region of Portugal. This data set includes information 
about student grades, demographic, social features and the 
school. In this study, students’ performance in mathematics has 
been evaluated. 
Keywords—educational data mining; feature selection; 
classification; data mining. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
The increase in the amount of data has revealed the subject 
of how to benefit from these data. The determination of the 
relevant information will be difficult in the assessment 
performed by conventional methods. Depending on the 
technology, data mining method has been widely used in recent 
years for the knowledge discovery from large data sets [1]. 
Usage area of data mining is quite large. Data mining can 
be used in almost every area where data is obtained. Health, 
industry, marketing, banking and education are the main areas 
in which data mining is heavily used [1]. Today, information 
related to education is stored in the database and especially, 
information such as personal information, grades, courses 
failed and courses completed successfully is stored in large 
databases. It may be possible to identify problems in the field 
of education and improving the quality of education with the 
determination of the significant and important information 
from these data sets. 
Some applications within the scope of educational data 
mining in the literature are as follows: Kotsiantis et al. [2] have 
used data mining techniques to predict performances of 
computer science students in a distance learning program of a 
university. Various demographic features and performance 
characteristics for each student have been given to the classifier 
as input. The best solution has been achieved with 74% 
accuracy using the Naive Bayes method. Also, it has been 
found that the past school grades have a much greater effect 
than demographic variables. In the study carried out by Halees 
[3], student behaviors have been tried to be evaluated with data 
mining and improving students' performance has been aimed 
according to the results achieved. For this purpose, personal, 
academic and e-learning system related records of 151 students 
have been used in Gaza Islamic University in 2007-2008 
academic years. Similarly, in the study carried out by 
Bresfelean et al. [4] student profiles have been tried to be 
revealed using classification and data aggregation methods in 
data mining and improving of student successes have been 
aimed with determining the causes of academic failure. Gaafar 
and Khanmis [5] have applied different data mining methods to 
the database created using data obtained from different 
databases. In this study, modeling of two different student 
profiles (as successful and unsuccessful) has been aimed. In the 
study carried out by Zhang et al. [6], it has been investigated 
that how data mining helps students under risk and how 
obtained results can be adapted to the students. In the study 
carried out by Bırtıl [7], the questionnaire applied to determine 
the reasons for failure of students have been analyzed by using 
clustering method of data mining methods. In this study, it is 
aimed to identify the factors for students being unsuccessful. In 
the study carried out by Gulen and Ozdemir [8], data has been 
obtained by applying Academic Self-Concept Scale and 
Recreational Survey to 12 and over year-old gifted students. 
Apriori association rule algorithm has been used for the 
knowledge discovery from obtained data. 
In this study, a feature selection-based data mining 
approach has been used for the estimation and evaluation of 
student success. In the study, real-world data obtained from 
two secondary schools in Portugal has been used. Portugal is a 
country that attracts attention in terms of education. 
Educational level of the population in Portugal has increased 
significantly in recent years. However, due to the high failure 
rates, Portugal is in the last row in Europe in terms of 
education. Significant decrease in success is seen especially in 
mathematics courses. The main purpose of this study is to 
predict student success and to identify important variables that 
affect educational success / failure. In this context, experiments 
have been performed on the data related to mathematic class.

year has been considered [9]. In Portugal, secondary education 
lasts 3 three years after 9-year basic education. After that, 
higher education begins. Students often take advantage of the 
free public education system. 20-point grade scale used for the 
evaluation of student success where 0 is the lowest grade and 
20 is the best grade. Students are evaluated in three different 
periods during the academic year and final evaluation  
corresponds to the final grade (Table I - G3). Data includes 
student grades, demographic, social and school-related 
features. Features and descriptions in the data set are presented 
in Table I [9].

B. ReliefF Feature Selection Algorithm 
Relief method performs the feature selection process using 
the distance information between samples in the data set [10]. 
In this method, a model is created depending on proximity of a 
sample in the data set to other samples in same class and 
depending on sample’s distance with different classes. The 
algorithm originally developed for the two-class problems has 
been adapted to the multi-class problems as ReliefF [11]. /g1849/g4670/g1827/g4671 
weight for an /g1827 feature in a /g1844 sample is calculated as below 
when nearest sample in its class is /g1834 and nearest samples in /g1829 
number of classes that it’s not belong are /g1839/g4666/g1829/g4667, 
/g26/g4670/g4/g4671/g3404/g3/g26/g4670/g4/g4671/g3398/g134/g139/g136/g136/g4666/g4/g481/g21/g481/g11/g4667/g143/g3397/g3 /g3533 /g3427/g19/g4666/g133/g4667/g154/g134/g139/g136/g136/g3435/g4/g481/g21/g484/g16/g4666/g6/g4667/g3439/g3431 /g143/g932

/g3416  (1) 
Here, /g1865 is normalization coefficient, /g1856/g1861/g1858/g1858 is the difference 
function between two samples. 
C. Decision Trees 
Decision tree is a rule-based algorithm commonly used in 
the solution of classification problems. The reason for the 
widespread preference of this method is the rules which are 
used to create the tree structure are understandable and simple. 
In this method, multi-stage or se quential approach is used in 
carrying out the classification process. In this study, C4.5 
algorithm has been preferred among the decision tree 
algorithms. 
D. Feed-Forward Neural Networks 
Artificial neural networks (ANN) is a mathematical system 
that has been developed taking into account the working 
principle of human brain. In this system, there are several 
processing units connected to each other in weighted form. 
These processing units receive signals from other neurons, 
unify them, transform them and reveal a numeric result. In this 
study, feed-forward neural network which is among the neural 
network models has been used. 
E. Support Vector Machines 
SVM is a machine learning method based on statistical 
learning theory. This method is a classification and regression 
method which easily classifies data sets (with the help of the 
kernel functions that it uses) that difficult to be classified 
(linear or nonlinear) [12]. The method determines the largest 
margin among many possible linear function to distinguish 
data which is linearly classifiable . It also transfers data which 
cannot be linearly classified to higher-dimensional space by 
using kernel functions and finds  multiple planes with the 
greatest margin. 
F. Kernel Based Extreme Learning Machine 
ELM is a learning algorithm developed for a feed-forward 
neural network with one hidden layer [13]. Unlike the 
gradient-based feed-forward networks, input weights and 
threshold values are randomly generated in ELM. In addition, 
analytical methods are used in the calculation of the output 
weights. In this way, the learning process is expedited. Huang 
et al. [14] proposed a kernel-based method to improve the 
generalization capabilities of ELM. Many kernel functions 
such as linear, polynomial and radial basis functions can be 
used in kernel-based ELM. In this study, polynomial kernel 
function has been preferred.","year has been considered. In Portugal, secondary education

algorithms. 
D. Feed-Forward Neural Networks 
Artificial neural networks (ANN) is a mathematical system 
that has been developed taking into account the working 
principle of human brain. In this system, there are several 
processing units connected to each other in weighted form. 
These processing units receive signals from other neurons, 
unify them, transform them and reveal a numeric result. In this 
study, feed-forward neural network which is among the neural 
network models has been used. 
E. Support Vector Machines 
SVM is a machine learning method based on statistical 
learning theory. This method is a classification and regression 
method which easily classifies data sets (with the help of the 
kernel functions that it uses) that difficult to be classified 
(linear or nonlinear). The method determines the largest 
margin among many possible linear function to distinguish 
data which is linearly classifiable . It also transfers data which 
cannot be linearly classified to higher-dimensional space by 
using kernel functions and finds  multiple planes with the 
greatest margin. 
F. Kernel Based Extreme Learning Machine 
ELM is a learning algorithm developed for a feed-forward 
neural network with one hidden layer. Unlike the 
gradient-based feed-forward networks, input weights and 
threshold values are randomly generated in ELM. In addition, 
analytical methods are used in the calculation of the output 
weights. In this way, the learning process is expedited. Huang 
et al. proposed a kernel-based method to improve the 
generalization capabilities of ELM. Many kernel functions 
such as linear, polynomial and radial basis functions can be 
used in kernel-based ELM. In this study, polynomial kernel 
function has been preferred."

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
The block diagram of the proposed method has been 
presented in Fig. 1. First, feature set has been submitted to the 
system. In next stage, normalization process has been applied 
(between 0-1) to the data to improve the performance of 
classification processes. Data has been reduced to 0-1 with 
normalization method. 
After normalization process, ReliefF algorithm has been used 
to determine efficient features. The sorting of efficient features 
obtained by applying ReliefF algorithm is as follows: f32, f31, f2, 
f9, f28, f7, f18, f15, f14, f4, f16, f17, f27, f6, f21, f5, f22, f29, f30, f8, f3, f1, 
f26, f11, f24, f25, f19, f23, f13, f20, f12, f10. Here, f3, represents second 
feature according to Table I, “age”. Effect ratios of some 
features are given in Fig. 2. 
In this study, Erasmus grade conversion system based 5-
levels classification approach has been used to estimate student 
success. Accordingly, grades are converted into 5 levels 
corresponding to particular ranges. This conversion table is 
presented in Table II.

Fig. 2. Effect ratio of the features 
 
Changes in the classification accuracy with the increase in 
the number of features selected by ReliefF algorithm are shown 
in Fig. 4. In general, it is observed that the best results are 
obtained with KELM algorithm. The highest classification 
accuracy has been obtained by classifying first 9 features by 
KELM algorithm. The effect of first two features on the results 
is quite high. These features are midterm grades (G1 and G2 
grades) of the students. The most successful result has been 
obtained with C4.5 decision tree algorithm after KELM 
algorithm.

IV. CONCLUSION 
In this study, a study was conducted for the evaluation and 
estimation of student success by using data mining techniques. 
The results obtained are presented below. 
• The effect of features selected by feature selection 
algorithm on the performance has been positive and 
more according to the use of all the features. Student 
success has been estimated with high accuracy with 
only nine features. 
• The study offers a different solution in terms of both 
identification of the most effective features among the 
features that are used and identification effective 
classification algorithm. 
• The effect of mid-term grades has been high in the 
estimation of the end of year success of the student. 
• The 9 features which give best results with KELM 
algorithm are as follows, respectively: G2, G1, 
student’s sex, mother’s job (Mjob), weekend alcohol 
consumption (Walc), Mother’s education (Medu), extra 
paid classes (paid), number of past class failures 
(failures), weekly study time (studytime). It can be said 
that these features significantly affect student success. 
• According to the obtained results, the factor least 
affecting student success is Father's Job.
