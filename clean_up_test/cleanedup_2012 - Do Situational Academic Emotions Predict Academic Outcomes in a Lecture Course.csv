Abstract 
This study explored the relationships between situational academic emotions, self-study time, and learning outcomes in a lecture course. T he 
participants were 107 Finnish first-year teacher students in a student-activating educational psychology lecture course. Interest and exhaustion were 
positively related, whereas anxiety was negatively related to the grade awarded for the course. These three situational academic emotions 
explained overall 29% of the course grade and they still predicted significant variance in grades even with the influences of s elf-reported self-
study time controlled. Finally, a mediation analysis revealed that  interest mediated the relationship between self-study time a nd learning 
outcomes.

1. Introduction 
Emotions and motivation have an increasing role in explaining university students’ learning and studying (Lonka et al., 2008). 
Previous studies indicate that positive learning experiences are related to academic outcomes as well as to well-being  (Pekrun, 
Goetz, Titz, & Perry, 2002). On the other hand, emotional and motivational problems in studying may pose a risk for both 
academic achievement and well-being (Heikkilä & Lonka, 2006). The relationships between emotions, motivation, learning 
outcomes and well-being have been less frequently studied (for an example see  Heikkilä, Lonka, Nieminen, & Niemivirta, in 
press). 
 
In our previous study (Lonka & Ketonen, in press) we used a person-oriented approach to examine what kinds of emotional 
profiles could be found to classify students according to the situational academic emotions they experienced during a lecture 
course and how these student groups differed in terms of flow experience, self-study time, and study success. In the study stud ent 
groups differed significantly in all academic emotions and the gr oups were labeled as engaged, unstressed, and anxious students . 
The engaged students spent the most hours in self-study and received the best grades. The unstressed students were the least 
active in self-study and least exhausted but also achieved the lowest grades (Lonka & Ketonen, in press). 
 
In the present study, we are interested in exploring more precisely which single situational academic emotions predict 
academic outcomes in a lecture context by using a variable-oriented approach. In addition, we want to examine what is the 
relation between academic emotions and self-study time when predicting learning outcomes.

1. Introduction 
Emotions and motivation have an increasing role in explaining university students’ learning and studying (Lonka et al., 2008). 
Previous studies indicate that positive learning experiences are related to academic outcomes as well as to well-being  (Pekrun, 
Goetz, Titz, & Perry, 2002). On the other hand, emotional and motivational problems in studying may pose a risk for both 
academic achievement and well-being (Heikkilä & Lonka, 2006). The relationships between emotions, motivation, learning 
outcomes and well-being have been less frequently studied (for an example see  Heikkilä, Lonka, Nieminen, & Niemivirta, in 
press). 
 
In our previous study (Lonka & Ketonen, in press) we used a person-oriented approach to examine what kinds of emotional 
profiles could be found to classify students according to the situational academic emotions they experienced during a lecture 
course and how these student groups differed in terms of flow experience, self-study time, and study success. In the study stud ent 
groups differed significantly in all academic emotions and the gr oups were labeled as engaged, unstressed, and anxious students . 
The engaged students spent the most hours in self-study and received the best grades. The unstressed students were the least 
active in self-study and least exhausted but also achieved the lowest grades (Lonka & Ketonen, in press). 
 
In the present study, we are interested in exploring more precisely which single situational academic emotions predict 
academic outcomes in a lecture context by using a variable-oriented approach. In addition, we want to examine what is the

1.1. Academic emotions and their importance to learning 
Pekrun et al. (2002) defined academic emotion  as “an emotion experienced in academic settings and related to studying, 
learning or instruction”. Such emotions are, for example, enjoyment of learning, pride of success, or test-related anxiety. 
Previously, academic emotions have largely been neglected in  educational psychology research, with the exception of 
achievement-related anxiety. Pekrun (2005) s uggested that students’ emotions are manifold and much richer in nature than the 
traditional views seem to suggest. All kinds of human emotions ma y play a role in learning and studying, including self- and ta sk 
related emotions, social emotions, and the variants of discrete emotions. 
 
In our previous study (Lonka & Ketonen, in press) academic emotions were measured using a modified version of PANAS 
scale (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) which focused on positive (interest, enthusiasm,  
determination, energy) and negative academic emotions (exhaustio n, anxiety, nervousness, irritation). The affects in the modifi ed 
PANAS were chosen partially based on Pekrun’s (1992; 2002; 2005) research. The variables in question were mainly similar to 
those previously used in contextual activity sampling by using mobile phones (Litmanen, Lonka, Inkinen, Lipponen, & 
Hakkarainen, in press). 
 
Academic emotions are social in nature and emotional experien ces are always situated in the immediate and broader social 
context (Opt’t Eynde & Turner, 2006). Lonka, Olkinuora, and Mäkinen (2004) draw a distinction between three levels of context 
when analyzing the role of motivational and cultural factors in studying and learning: the general, domain- or course-spesific,  
and situational levels. The academic emotions measured in this st udy can be regarded as situational, since they are experienced in 
a certain moment. However, they are also contextual, because the lecture context and previous dispositions have an impact on 
what emotions are triggered. 
 
Most investigators differentiate between so-called momentary or state  emotions and long-term trait levels of affect (Diener, 
1999).  Inst ead of
 viewing emotion as a trait, which refers to temperamental qualities and consistent and stable long-term 
individual differences in affective experi ence, we could rather talk about various general dispositions in affective experience . A 
state emotion, on the other hand, usually refers to a transi ent reaction to specific kinds of adaptive encounters (Lazarus, 1994). 
For example, someone experiences anxiety at a particular time and place; the state comes and goes along with the circumstances.  
When emotion is viewed as a state, we want to know what it is about the situation that generates anxiety for example, 
distinguished from other emotions (Lazarus, 1994). In this study we refer to the above-mentioned situational-level or state 
emotions when applying the term academic emotions. 
 
Teachers can  i
nfluence their students’ emotions, although it may be difficult to make teachers change their instructional 
behaviour so that student emotions are fostered (Pekrun, 2005). However, research on the impact of classroom instruction, 
learning environments, and social contexts on the de velopment of academic emotions is scarce (Pekrun, 2005).  Lonka and 
Ketonen (in pr
ess) showed that situational emotions were related to learning outcomes in a lecture course. Their result was in line 
with Ainley, Corrigan,  and Richardson (2005) who indicated in their study that situational emotions may be central to the 
arousal and 
maintenance of students’ interest, motivation, volition, and effort. It has also been shown that academic emotions are 
significantly related to students’ learning strategies, cognitive processes, self-regulation, and academic achievement, as well  as to 
classroom antecedents, personality, and psychological health (Pekrun et al., 2002). 
 
Student en
gagement has appeared increasingly in the literature as a positive mechanism to help students improve academic 
performance (Schaufeli, Martínez, Pinto, Salanova, & Bakker, 2002). In our previous study (Lonka & Ketonen, in press) it 
appeared that engaged students reported more exhaustion than unstressed students, who did not appeared engaged.  The engaged 
students possibly experienced exhaustion, since their course involvement was intense and they worked very hard. Students who 
study hard are susceptible to high exhaustion because they view their studies extremely important and place high personal 
demands on themselves. Sometimes exhausted university students may also skip class, do poorly on assignments and exams, and 
ultimately drop out of school (Law, 2007). When exhaustion is related to the presence of negative emotions it may be more 
harmful. However, exhaustion is not necessarily only a negative thing as long as it is related to engagement and involvement. 
 
Learning-related enjoyment presupposes that the student has a sense of being able to master the task. On the other hand, 
anxiety is assumed to be triggered when expectations imply po ssible failure (Pekrun et al., 2002). If the challenge is high, and  
the feeling of competence is high, there is a possibility of experiencing flow. In contrast, if the challenge is high, but the person 
feels inadequate, this results in anxiety (Csikszentmihalyi, 1994). People often report positive affects, such as engagement an d 
enthusiasm, in relation to flow, whereas more negative affects are reported when there is a mismatch between challenges and 
competencies (Delle Fave & Massimini, 2005). Also in our previous study (Lonka & Ketonen, in press), anxious students 
reported a high level of challenge but weak competence combined with high levels of negative emotions. 
 
Generally, positive activating emotions, like enthusiasm and joy, may be assumed to affect achievement positively. In 
contrast, negative deactivating emotions, li ke boredom or apathy, may generally be detrimental because they reduce motivation 
and direct attention away from the task (Pekrun et al, 2002).  The effect of positive deactivating as well as negative activati ng 
emotions, on the other hand, may be equivocal. Positive deactivat ing emotions, like satisfaction or relief, may be detrimental for","1.1. Academic emotions and their importance to learning

immediate performance while negative activating emotions, such as anger and anxiety, may benefit achievement (Pekrun et al., 
2002). Thus, simplistic conceptions of negative emotions as bad and positive emotions as being good when predicting academic 
outcomes should be avoided. 
 
In the present study, the first aim was to investigate which single situational academic emotions are related to academic 
outcomes in a lecture course. The academic emotions were meas ured contextually by using a questionnaire during a lecture 
situation. It was revealed already by the person-oriented appr oach that different emotional student profiles had different lear ning 
outcomes (Lonka & Ketonen, in press). Furthermore, in the pr esent study self-reported self-study time was included as an 
additional variable to predict learning outcomes. We wanted to explore whether self-study time would function as a predictor of  
learning outcomes independent of the contributions of the academic emotions, and on the other hand, whether academic 
emotions would predict learning outcomes in regressions even if self-reported self-study time was included and controlled in th e 
model. 
 
1.2. The role of interest in studying and learning 
In our previous study, interest was central in study engageme nt (Lonka & Ketonen, in press). Interest may be defined as a 
psychological state that is characterized by an affectiv e component of positive emotion and a cognitive component of 
concentration (Hidi & Renninger, 2006). It is a mental state where intellectual activity has a target and where positive emotio ns 
are involved (Tsai, Kunter, Ludtke, Trautwein, & Ryan, 2008). Thus, interest is always content-specific and not a predispositio n 
that applies generally across all activities (Krapp, 2000). Intere st develops in the interaction between a person and the 
surrounding context. The potential for interest is in the person but the context and the environment define the direction of in terest 
and contribute to its development (Hidi & Renninger, 2006). Such instruction that activates prior knowledge,  supports autonomy 
and a sense of
 control, and where the goals are transparent,  has been reported to promote interest (Tsai et al., 2008). 
 
According to the proposal made by Krapp, Hidi, and Renninger (1992), most researchers differentiate between situational and 
individual or personal interest. Hidi and Renninger (2006) presented the  model of  how interest develops . The first phase of the 
four-phase model presented by Hidi and Renninger (2006) is a  triggered situational interest . For instance, an interesting text or 
lecture may trigger this kind of interest. If situational interest  is sustained, it elaborates into the second phase, that is, maintained 
situational interest . The student may read more about the topic or return to listen to the interestin g speaker, for example. The 
third phase is characterized by an emerging individual interest . It takes place, if the student begins to pose curiosity questions, 
seek repeated engagement and has not only positive feelings but also increased stored knowledge and value for particular 
content. If maintained by active deep learning, emerging in dividual interest may lead into the fourth phase, namely, a well-
developed individual interest. This phase allows the individual to sustain long-term learning activities. 
 
Earlier phases of interest development appear to be fuelled by affect, but each phase also includes some form of prior 
knowledge or cognitive processing although the latter components are more pronounced in the later phases. It is important to 
point out that triggered situational interest may take place with out effort, but individual interest calls for prior knowledge (Hidi & 
Renninger, 2006). Thus, interest includes always not only affective but also cognitive components. Prior knowledge, for 
instance, has been shown to be associated with more interest (Alexander, Jetton, & Kulikowich, 1995). However, knowledge is 
not a sole component of interest, nor is affect. Interest development involves the interaction of knowledge and affects (Hidi &  
Renninger, 2006). 
 
Interest has repeatedly been recognized as an important condition for learning. The empirical findings show that learning 
based on interest tends to have many positive effects on the process and results of learning, especially with respect to qualit ative 
criteria (Krapp, 2002). For example, situational interest has been  shown to influence positively cognitive performances such as  
focused attention, higher cognitive functioning, and learning (H idi & Renninger, 2006). Harackiewicz, Barron, Tauer, and Elliot  
(2002) reported that interest combines with external factors to  predict academic outcomes among college students.  One possible  
mechanism is that situational interest makes students work ha rder and become engaged, which again leads to better learning 
outcomes. In addition, the positive emotions associated with in terest have been found to contribute to cognitive performance 
(Ainley, Hillman, & Hidi, 2002; Krapp, 2002). 
 
Previous research indicates that emotions may be critical for the arousal and maintenance of interest (Pekrun, 2005). For 
example situational emotions triggered by a text can transform into an interest to continue reading. In Pekrun et al.’s (2002) 
study, positive academic emotions correlated positively with stud ents’ interest and self-reported academic effort. In contrast,  
negative deactivating emotions correlated negatively with interest and self-reported effort. Also Hidi and Renninger (2006) 
emphasize the importance of positive emotions in the developmen t of interest. In our previous study (Lonka & Ketonen, in 
press), engaged students reported high levels of interest but at the same time some exhaustion. Students who feel most dedicate d 
to their study usually show the least cynicism, but do not necessarily feel low in exhaustion (Schaufeli et al., 2002). Thus, i t 
seems that interest is a positive emotion that prevents cynicism but can at the same time lead into ‘positive’ exhaustion.","immediate performance while negative activating emotions, such as anger and anxiety, may benefit achievement (Pekrun et al.,

In the present study we treat interest as an affect. Interest can be perceived as an emotional experience, when it is seen as a  
pleasant and activating emotion in contrast to unpleasant and deactivating affect like boredom (Barrett, Mesquita, Ochsner, & 
Gross, 2007; Watson et al., 1988; Yik, Russell, & Feldman Barret, 1999). We are aware, however, of its close linkage to 
attention and cognition and that it is not a general feature, bu t has always a target (Renninger & Hidi, 2011). In the present study 
we investigated how reported interest is related to academic outc omes and further, the time invested in self-study. This lecture 
was previously reported to be highly interesting and engaging from  the participants’ perspective (Lonka & Ketonen, in press). 
Thus, the second goal of the study was to explore whether inte rest mediated the relationship between self-study time and learni ng 
outcomes. In sum, the present study was designed to explore the relationships between academic emotions, self-study time, and 
academic outcomes in a lecture context. 
 
2. Method 
2.1. Participants 
The participants were 107 Finnish first-year elementary- and kindergarten teacher students who attended an introductory course 
in educational psychology at the University of Helsinki. Overall, 77% of the students who attended the course filled in the 
questionnaire used in this study. The ages ranged from 19 to  51 years (mean 23.6, standard deviation 5.37). Women (85%) were 
overrepresented in this study compared to men (15%), which reflects the gender distribution in teacher education at the University of 
Helsinki. 
 
2.2. Procedure 
The data were collected in December, 2009 from students attending a student-activating lecture course in educational 
psychology (the context is described in more detail in Lonka & Ketonen, in press). The participants filled in a questionnaire 
during the last lecture of the course, five days before the course exam. 
 
The purpose of the study was explained to all participants. It was emphasised that the involvement was voluntary and that the 
participants could decide not to complete the questionnaire at any time. All participants signed an informed consent form, 
including a consent to gather the course grades. Of the 107 par ticipants, 92 both filled in the questionnaire and attended the 
course exam. In statistical analyses, the largest possible number of participants was included in each analysis. 
 
2.3. Materials 
The self-report questionnaire consisted of Likert-type question s to assess academic emotions, motivational factors, problems 
in studying, and procrastination. In this study, we focused on academic emotions which were each measured on a situational 
level in a certain context. Academic emotions were assessed  using a modified PANAS scale (Watson et al., 1988; see also 
Litmanen et al., in press; Tolvanen et al., 2011), consisting of four positive affects (interest, enthusiasm, determination, en ergy) 
and four negative affects (exhaustion, anxiety, nervousness, irritation). All items were answered using a Likert-scale ranging 
from (1) not at all to (7) very much. In addition, the participan ts were asked to evaluate how many hours they had spent on sel f-
study by the time they filled in the questionnaire. 
 
Learning outcomes were measured by using the grades obtain ed from t
 he course from which the data were collected. The 
course exam was arranged five days after the last lecture and called for understanding and application of knowledge, and learni ng 
details by heart was not rewarded. The final grade was given on  the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) 
scale of 1(no understanding) to 5 (deep understanding).

3.1. Descriptive analysis 
 
Mean scores, standard deviations, and the range of scores are pr esented in Table 1 for each variable used in this study. The 
scores indicate that the participants felt more positive than negative emotions and found the course very interesting. The 
participants were also quite enthusiastic and determined five days before the course exam. The reported hours spent on self-stu dy","In the present study we treat interest as an affect. Interest can be perceived as an emotional experience, when it is seen as a  
pleasant and activating emotion in contrast to unpleasant and deactivating affect like boredom. We are aware, however, of its close linkage to 
attention and cognition and that it is not a general feature, bu t has always a target. In the present study 
we investigated how reported interest is related to academic outc omes and further, the time invested in self-study. This lecture 
was previously reported to be highly interesting and engaging from  the participants’ perspective. 
Thus, the second goal of the study was to explore whether inte rest mediated the relationship between self-study time and learni ng 
outcomes. In sum, the present study was designed to explore the relationships between academic emotions, self-study time, and 
academic outcomes in a lecture context. 
 
2. Method 
2.1. Participants 
The participants were 107 Finnish first-year elementary- and kindergarten teacher students who attended an introductory course 
in educational psychology at the University of Helsinki. Overall, 77% of the students who attended the course filled in the 
questionnaire used in this study. The ages ranged from 19 to  51 years (mean 23.6, standard deviation 5.37). Women (85%) were 
overrepresented in this study compared to men (15%), which reflects the gender distribution in teacher education at the University of 
Helsinki.

3.2. Predicting academic outcomes 
 
A stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to predict learning outcomes. All eight academic emotions listed in 
Table 1 were entered into the analysis as possible independent predictor variables. Table 3 shows the results. Of the eight 
academic emotions interest, exhaustion, and anxiety accounted for si gnificant shares of the course grade variance, with interes t 
and exhaustion being the most significant single predictors of learning outcomes. The higher the student assessed his or her 
interest and exhaustion and the lower he or she assessed the leve l of anxiety, the better the student tended to do in the cours e 
exam. These three variables explained 29% of the variance (measured by R
2) and were all significantly related to course grade at 
p < .004 or beyond.

In addition to academic emotions, one additional variable included in the second regression analysis as a possible predictor 
was an estimate of self-study time. To determine how much predictive power self-reported self-study time and academic 
emotions have on learning outcomes, the second analysis consis ted of a hierarchical multiple regression model to predict the 
course grade. Predictors were included in two blocks in the fo llowing order. First, self-study time was entered as the first block to 
include variance attributable to time invested in self-study be fore the emotional influences were included. The second block 
consisted of three academic emotions (interest, exhaustion, anxiet y) which were proven to be significantly related to learning 
outcomes in the first analysis. The results of the second regression analysis appear in Table 4. 
 
The addition of both blocks of predictors significantly in creased the proportion of variance explained in the learning 
outcomes. In the first step, self-reported self-study time significantly predicted course grades. However, with the addition of  
interest, exhaustion, and anxiety in the second step, self-study time did not remain a significant predictor. Thus, in the fina l 
equation after the second step, learning outcomes were significa ntly predicted by academic emotions only, similarly to the firs t 
regression analysis. Taken together, the second regression model accounted for 35% of the explained variance in students’ 
learning outcomes.","3.2. Predicting academic outcomes

3.3. The mediating role of interest 
 
To test if interest acts as a mechanism through which self-study time predicts academic outcomes, a mediational analysis was 
conducted following the recommendations of Baron and Kenny (1986). All variables are required to correlate significantly with 
each other in order to the mediation to be examined. Se lf-study time correlated significantly with interest, r = .35, p < .001; and 
learning outcomes, r = .33, p < .001. Likewise, interest was significantly associated with learning outcomes, r = .41, p < .001. 
Therefore, the preconditions of mediation (Baron & Kenny, 1986) we re met. Figure 1 illustrates that the direct path from self-
study time to learning outcomes remained significant after th e inclusion of interest in the analysis; however, the basic 
relationship was significantly reduced, Sobel’s z = 2.54, p = .01, CI 95% [0.02, 0.13].
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because the sampling distribution of the indirect effect is no t always symmetrical or normal, especially in small samples 
(Bollen & Stine, 1990); we also used bootstrapping which produces a test that is not based on large-sample theory, meaning it 
can be applied to small samples with more confidence. The bootstrapped estimate of the indirect effect was similar to the point  
estimate computed from the conventional regression analysis of the raw data, and the true indirect effect was estimated to lie 
between 0.0160 and 0.1367 with 95% confidence. Because zero is not in the 95% confidence interval, we can conclude that the 
indirect effect is indeed significantly different from zero at p < .05 (two-tailed). 
 
Thus, interest partially mediated the relationship between self-r eported self-study time and learning outcomes. The mediating 
path (indirect path) from self-study time to learning outcomes was also significant; however, the direct effect of self-study time 
on learning outcomes ( r = .23) was stronger than the indirect path through interest ( r = .10). For the ease of interpretation, all 
values presented in the figure 1 are standardized coefficients.

4. Discussion 
This study showed how situational academic emotions played an important role in successful studying. In a lecture context the 
academic emotions measured five days before the course exam significantly predicted academic outcomes.The results of the 
regression analyses suggest that a greater interest contributes significantly to students’ learning outcomes in a lecture cours e. The 
finding is consistent with previous research (Hidi & Renninger, 2006; Krapp, 2002). 
 
Interestingly, exhaustion was not harmful in this context. Exha ustion related  positively to course grade, suggesting, perhaps, a 
commitment to the studies. This is in lin e with previous studies indicating that committed students may sometimes be exhausted 
(Schaufeli et al., 2002) and stressed (Litmanen, Hirsto, & Lonka, 2010), since they invest a lot of hard work in studying. Thus , 
instead of being a negative consequence, exhaustion can be seen here as a positive sign of vigour, dedication, and absorption, all 
of which are characteristic of engagement (Schaufeli et al., 2002). 
 
Anxiety, on the other hand, appeared to be harmful in terms of  academic outcomes in this cont ext. Previous research showed 
that test anxiety  can reduce working memory resources, leading to an impairment  of performance at complex or difficult tasks 
that draw on
 these resources. Consequently, test anxiety tends to correlate  negatively with academic achievement at school and 
unive
rsity (Pekrun et al., 2002). However, the effects of negative activating emotions seem to be ambivalent. Because of their 
activating nature, negative activating emotions can induce a strong motivation to cope with the negative events that caused the m, 
thus strengthening specific kinds of extrinsic motivation. For ex ample, test-related anxiety may induce the motivation to avoid  
failure by investing effort, thus strengthening academic motivation (Pekrun et al., 2002). However in this context anxiety seem ed 
to lead to behavioral freezing instead of activation. 
 
The lack of other significant relations with course grade suggests that general enthusiasm, determination, or energy might not 
be as decisive when predicting learning outcomes compared to interest which differs from the other positive emotions due to the  
fact that it always has a target and intellectual activity is invol ved (Tsai et al., 2008). On the other hand interest is a men tal state 
where positive emotions are highly involved (Tsai et al., 2008) and because of the strong correlations between all the positive  
emotions, there may not have been predictive power left to the other affects after interest was included in the model. 
 
However, only 29% of the total variance in course grades was accounted for in the first regression model suggesting that 
although academic emotions are important contributors to learning outcomes, other factors not assessed here like previous 
knowledge and performance, achievement goals and different test-rel ated situational factors must also contribute in a major way  
to academic outcomes. In the second regression analysis we added self-reported self-study time to the model to see if this fact or 
could explain the achieved grades even more than the academic emotions. Surprisingly, interest, exhaustion, and anxiety 
remained significant even with variance owing to self-reported self-study time included and controlled in the second regression  
model. In fact, reported academic emotions we re more powerful predictors of learning outcomes than invested self-study time 
five days before the course exam. After adding interest, exhaustion, and anxiety in the model, self-reported self-study time di d 
not remain a significant predictor. This finding further emphas ises that experienced emotions are important when predicting 
successful studying. Furthermore, these results suggest that self-study time may not be as important a predictor of academic 
outcomes as are academic emotions, at least in certain academic contexts. 
 
It was not clear why such a general measure of studying as self-reported time spent on self-study did not emerge as a predictor  
of learning outcomes when emotional influences were included. The finding that interest in this study was a better predictor of  
learning outcomes than was self-reported self-study time may reflect in part the nature of demands of the course exam, calling 
for understanding and application of knowledge, not remembering de tails by heart. In addition, the mediation analysis revealed 
that the relationship between self-study time and learning outcomes was partially mediated by the interest experienced. 
Conceptually, this means that self-study time is associated with academic outcomes also through a mechanism of increased 
interest. This finding refers to the conception that more reading or studying also increases interest in the topic and that 
particularly individual interest calls for prior knowledge (Hidi & Renninger, 2006). 
 
Although we did not have longitudinal data, which could more fully elucidate causal pathways, th e indirect effect identified 
here with concurrent data suggests that self-study predicts in creased interest, and this, in tu rn, predicts better learning outcomes. 
Because this study used concurrent data, it is not possible to disentangle the direction of causality among these variables. We 
assumed, however, based on theoretical background and previous research that studying and increase in knowledge could prompt 
an increase in interest (Alexander et al., 1995; Hidi & Renninger, 2006). It is likely, however, that there is a reciprocal 
relationship between these factors, where interest also plays a causal role on self-studying. Fu rther studies should replicate this 
pathway with larger sample sizes and longitudinal data. 
 
Our findings point also to the need for studies of how the characteristics of the academic context may mediate the relationship  
between academic emotions and learning outcomes. Our ongoing studies in the field of engineering and other domains shall 
show whether we can generalize these results. Besides the context and the domain also the phase of study can impact on results.  
It would be interesting to examine if the results are similar among more advanced students. Also a longitudinal study that 
examines how students’ general study orientations are related to experienced situational academic emotions, and the other way","4. Discussion

five days before the course exam. After adding interest, exhaustion, and anxiety in the model, self-reported self-study time di d 
not remain a significant predictor. This finding further emphas ises that experienced emotions are important when predicting 
successful studying. Furthermore, these results suggest that self-study time may not be as important a predictor of academic 
outcomes as are academic emotions, at least in certain academic contexts. 
 
It was not clear why such a general measure of studying as self-reported time spent on self-study did not emerge as a predictor  
of learning outcomes when emotional influences were included. The finding that interest in this study was a better predictor of  
learning outcomes than was self-reported self-study time may reflect in part the nature of demands of the course exam, calling 
for understanding and application of knowledge, not remembering de tails by heart. In addition, the mediation analysis revealed 
that the relationship between self-study time and learning outcomes was partially mediated by the interest experienced. 
Conceptually, this means that self-study time is associated with academic outcomes also through a mechanism of increased 
interest. This finding refers to the conception that more reading or studying also increases interest in the topic and that 
particularly individual interest calls for prior knowledge. 
 
Although we did not have longitudinal data, which could more fully elucidate causal pathways, th e indirect effect identified 
here with concurrent data suggests that self-study predicts in creased interest, and this, in tu rn, predicts better learning outcomes. 
Because this study used concurrent data, it is not possible to disentangle the direction of causality among these variables. We 
assumed, however, based on theoretical background and previous research that studying and increase in knowledge could prompt 
an increase in interest. It is likely, however, that there is a reciprocal 
relationship between these factors, where interest also plays a causal role on self-studying. Fu rther studies should replicate this 
pathway with larger sample sizes and longitudinal data. 
 
Our findings point also to the need for studies of how the characteristics of the academic context may mediate the relationship  
between academic emotions and learning outcomes. Our ongoing studies in the field of engineering and other domains shall 
show whether we can generalize these results. Besides the context and the domain also the phase of study can impact on results.  
It would be interesting to examine if the results are similar among more advanced students. Also a longitudinal study that 
examines how students’ general study orientations are related to experienced situational academic emotions, and the other way"

be in ord
er. Research is needed to test potentially recipr ocal longitudinal relationships between general dispositions and 
situational factors in studying to better understand the direction of effect  between t hese factors. In future, we are also interested 
in how academic emotions are related to students’ general motivation, well-being, achievement, and quality of learning instead of 
single grades. 
 
Furthermore, new contextual ways of measuring academic emoti ons have been developed. For instance, our Finnish research 
group measured academic emotions, interest, sense of competence, and challenge using the Contextually Activated Sampling 
System (CASS) method (Litmanen et al., in press; Muukkonen et al., 2007; Muukkonen, Hakkarainen, Inkinen, Lonka, & 
Salmela-Aro, 2008; Tolvanen et al., 2011). This method enables gather ing real time data of academic emotions also in contexts 
other than a formal lecture situation. 
 
While it seems clear that students’ emotions develop in social contexts, we do not yet know how this process can be fostered 
so that enjoyment of learning is enhanced, and so that negative emotions hindering learning are prevented or put to productive 
use. Future research on academic emotions should include more  intervention studies and provide information on how instruction 
and social interaction with students can be modified to foster students’ emotional development.
