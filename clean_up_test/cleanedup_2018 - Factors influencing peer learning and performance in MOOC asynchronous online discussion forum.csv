Factors influencing peer learning and performance in MOOC 
asynchronous online discussion forum

Most studies on traditional asynchronous online discussion suggest that facilitating dialogue, 
that is, commenting forum activities, result in better learning and performance. However, due to 
open entry and diverse learner backgrounds, learner behaviour in massive open online courses 
(MOOCs) may be different. Viewing forum messages, which involves fewer mental and 
physical actions as well as less cognitive processing, rather than posting forum massages, might 
better match the learner’s study purpose. In this study, we investigated the effects of three 
common types of online MOOC discussion forum activities (viewing, voting and commenting) 
on student peer learning (peer reviews) and performance (quiz scores). We used stepwise 
regression models to analyse two data samples of a humanity and art MOOC provided by a 
private university in the United States for exploring factors influencing peer learning and 
performance. The results indicate that peer learning and performance were primarily predicted 
by viewing, and to a lesser extent by commenting. The three plausible explanations for the 
findings are the learner’s study purpose, weaker instructor-learner ties, and voluntary forum 
participation. We suggest ways to encourage viewing messages in forums and present 
limitations and further directions.  
 
Introduction 
 
The advent of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has revolutionised online education (Billsberry, 2013; 
Lucas, 2013) and has stolen the limelight in academia in the last several years (Haggard, 2013). MOOCs, usually 
run by educational technology service providers such as EdX and Coursera in partnership with reputable 
universities, are free and open to all, and allow all kinds of individuals to enrol. Anyone can enrol in the courses 
out of  interest; for exa mple, a mathematics professor can enrol  and study a history MOOC. The courses 
welcome novice as well as advanced learners (Yang, Wen, Howley, Kraut, & Rose, 2015). In a MOOC, the 
participants can consist of school pupils, university students, or research s cientists (DeBoer, Stump, Seaton, & 
Breslow, 2013; Gillani & Eynon, 2014), indicating a  large diversity in many aspects, such as motivation, 
learning styles and goals.  
 
Open entry and diverse learner background lead to an unsupervised learning environment  with distant 
relationships between peers and instructors  (Garrison, Anderson, Archer, & 2010; Moon, Potdar, & Martin, 
2014).   As a result, MOOC learners are very likely to engage in learning activities in a different way compared 
to those studying in onl ine courses in formal , conventional programs. In conventional learning environments, 
learners usually know one another or share the same interest s and academic goals. They are also supervised or 
given detailed guidance by their teachers. In contrast, a MOOC generally carries no fees, and no predefined 
expectations for participation (McAuley, Stewart, Siemens, & Cormier, 2010). Learners sign up for MOOCs 
voluntarily (Alraimi, Zo, & Ciganek, 2015), and do not know most of their peers (DeBoer et al., 2013; Gillani 
& Eynon, 2014). They have freedom to participate in the learning activities. But perhaps the biggest difference 
between a MOOC and an ordinary course is the size of the  enrolment. The average enrol ment in MOOCs is 
about 43,000 students (Ferenstein,  2014) who are very diverse in terms of nationality and educational level 
(Breslow et al., 2013). 
 
In this paper, we use the term closed  to describe the conventional , formal learning environment, and open  to 
describe the MOOC learning environment. For example, closed asynchronous discussion refers to forum-based 
discussion in conventional learning environments such as university, credit-bearing, face-to-face and online 
courses, while open asynchronous discussion refers to the forums in MOOCs. Hitherto, most  research on 
asynchronous discussion forums has been  conducted in closed environments (e.g. , Dennen, 2005; Hew,","Factors influencing peer learning and performance in MOOC

Open entry and diverse learner background lead to an unsupervised learning environment  with distant

In this paper, we use the term closed  to describe the conventional , formal learning environment, and open  to 
describe the MOOC learning environment. For example, closed asynchronous discussion refers to forum-based 
discussion in conventional learning environments such as university, credit-bearing, face-to-face and online

Cheung, & Ng, 2010; Masters & Oberprieler, 2004; Vonderwell, 2003); little research has studied the impacts 
of forums in open environment s, such as MOOCs. In particular, relatively few studies have examined how 
forum activities with different cognitive processing, especially commenting, viewing and voting, may influence 
student performance and participation in large -scale open learning environment s. An investigation of open , 
asynchronous discussion activities in MOOCs can help further our understanding of student participation in 
online environments. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to investigate the effect of viewing, voting, and 
commenting (activities ranging from lower to higher cognitive processing ), on students ’ peer learning and 
performance in a MOOC. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: we first present a summary of previous 
studies on MOOCs and asynchronous online discus sion activities and their cognitive processing , followed by 
the purpose and methodology of the study. Then we describe the results of our analyses, followed by discussing 
the results and concluding the study. 
 
Literature review 
 
Research in MOOCs 
 
Studies on MOOCs have concentrated on two major research themes or strands. One of these strands is student 
completion and dropout in MOOCs. For example, Alraimi et al. (2015) suggested that openness and reputation 
are stronger factors affecting a learner’s decision to continue learning in MOOCs when compared to enjoyment 
and usefulness. Completion rate in a MOOC is higher when its instructor is from a more prestigious university 
(Alraimi et al., 2015), or when the educational materials are more visible and accessible, that is, uploaded to 
the learning management system at the beginning of the course, (Alraimi et al., 2015; Iiyoshi & Kumar, 2008). 
MOOC learners prefer to easily retrieve resources from the platform for self-learning purposes. Pedagogy also 
plays an important role in helping the learners to persist in the course. Many studies suggest that learning 
activities and instructional approach are important in MOOCs (Chen & Chen, 2015; Onah, Sinclair, & Boyatt, 
2014; Rai & Chunrao, 2016). Chen and Chen (2015) suggested that offline face-to-face study groups are a key 
influential factor of student participation and motivation. Onah et al.  (2014) suggested that MOOC instructors 
use different presentations  – videos, audios, slides, pictures and documents –  for resources and activities to 
uphold learner interest. Rai and Chunrao (2016) suggested MOOC learners who receive sufficient support and 
timely feedback are more likely to continue until the end of the courses. Nawrot and Doucet (2014) found that 
most students dropped out due to conflicting life responsibilities and interruptions during the course , such as 
being left behind because of work or travel. 
 
The second major research strand in MOOCs concerns student learning and performance. Major MOOC student 
learning activities include watching video lectures, participating in discussion forums, performing peer reviews, 
and completing tests and assignments. In general, MOOC learners watch video lectures, and then discuss a topic 
with peers and their instructor o r facilitators. After that, learners a re required to finish tests, assignments , or 
peer reviews. These activities can be generally classified into two categories: receiving information (e.g., video 
lectures, and interacting with peers and instructors (e.g. , discussion forums). Coffrin, Corrin, de Barba , and 
Kennedy (2014) found that many more students viewed the videos than worked on the assignments. Although 
MOOCs rely mainly on discussion forums for interaction among students (Coetzee, Fox, Hearst, & Hartmann, 
2014), only about 5%–12% of participants write posts in the forums (Bárcena, Read, Martín-Monje, & Castrillo, 
2014; Cisel, 2014; Kizilcec, Papadopoulos, & Sritanyaratana, 2014). More than 75% of participants read 
discussion threads only once (Cisel, 2014).  
 
One of the issues we need to address is  that MOOCs lack a physical environment that allows real -time 
interaction between learners and instructors (Ezen -Can, Boyer, Kellogg, & Booth, 2015; Moon et al., 2014; 
Wong, Pursel, Divinsky, & Jansen, 2015) , and hence online discussion forums in MOOCs pla y an important 
role in trying to bridge this gap (Moon et al., 2014). R esearchers have also begun to examine the effects of 
forum participation on student learning. Coetzee et al. (2014), for example, found a positive correlation between 
the number of responses to forum questions and students’ final grades and course retention. Students who posted 
at least one message obtained higher achievements (i.e., receiving advanced course certificates). The number 
of viewed threads was also associated with achievemen t; students who received course certificates read the","little research has studied the impacts

forums more than others (Cisel, 2014). These indicate that online forum activities can influence student 
performance in MOOCs.  
 
Asynchronous online discussion forum activities and cognitive processing  
 
Many studies have suggested that proper use of asynchronous online discussion in conventional formal learning 
environments engages learners and improves performance (Brewer & Klein, 2006; Chen & Chiu, 2008; Cheung 
& Hew, 2004; Hew et al., 201 0; Khine, Yea p, & Chin Lok, 2003; Oliver & Shaw, 2003). Learners in these 
studies had similar backgrounds ; for example, all learners were pre- service teachers ( Cheung & Hew,  2004; 
Hew et al., 2010; Khine et al., 2003; Vonderwell, 2003) or had similar academic backgrounds: business (Brewer 
& Klein, 2006), mathematics (Chen & Chiu, 2008) and health science (Masters & Oberprieler, 2004; Oliver & 
Shaw, 2003). Therefore, literature on online forum use has focused on investigating how to engage student 
participation in closed  asynchronous online discussions (e.g. , Dennen, 2005; Hew et al., 201 0; Masters & 
Oberprieler, 2004; Vonderwell, 2003). Online forums provide an environment that facilitates dialogue between 
learners and instructors (Dennen, 2005; Hew et al., 2010). Studies have focused on recommending instructional 
strategies to facilitate commenting  and responding. For example, Hew  et al.  (2010) reviewed 50 empirical 
studies on asynchronous online discussions. Participants in the reviewed studies were from the same institution, 
shared the same educational level or had a similar educational background. They further suggested that one of 
the major factors influencing student participation in discussion s is the response time to learners’ questions. 
Without receiving timely responses, learners feel frustrated and discouraged ( Cheung & Hew, 2004). Dennen 
(2005) has suggested that presenting detailed guidance and deadline s positively affects the discourse in  an 
online course. An, Shin,  and Lim (2009) and Dennen (2005) reported the relationship between learners and 
their instructors as another important factor affecting learner motivation to comment in online discussions.  The 
group sizes in these studies were small, which enabled the instructors to be more involved in the online forums. 
Involvement of the instructor is a major factor influencing learner contribution (An et al., 2009; Dennen, 2005; 
Cheung & Hew, 2004; Wang, 2008; Mazzolini & Maddison, 2007). More constructive and timely feedback can 
encourage learners to participate more in the discussion forum. When learners feel less involvement from their 
instructors, they a re unlikely to post or respond in the discussions (Dennen, 2005). In the above studies , 
instructional strategies involved only one online forum activity –  commenting messages. In other words, 
commenting on messages is the important factor affecting participation in closed asynchronous discussions.  
 
In contrast, the learning environment and  the nature of learner s in MOOCs different. Commenting messages 
may not be the most influential factors in such an open environment. MOOC learners are voluntary (Alraimi et 
al., 2015) and self -regulated (Kop & Fournier, 2011; Yang et al., 2015) , and do not know most of their peers 
(DeBoer et al., 2013; Gillani & Eynon, 2014). They have the freedom to participate in the tasks of their choice 
at their own pace even if the completion of tasks is required for acquiring certificates (Onah et al., 2014). They 
may prefer to read messages than respond because of their busy schedules , while learners in a conventional 
formal programme follow the assessment criteria or methods and focus on meeting instructor and course 
requirements. MOOC learners select tasks they perceive as useful. This selective participation and learner -
preferred learning process further indicate the challenges MOOC instructors face in contrast to  conventional 
online courses. This process also implies that cognitive processing should be considered when designing forum 
activities for learners in open learning environments (Garrison et al., 2010).  
 
Cognitive processing of activities affects student learning and engagement ( Chiu & Churchill, 2015a, 2016; 
Chiu & Mok, 2017; Garrison et al., 2010), which plays an important role in online educational practice, 
particularly in open online learning (Garrison et al., 2010; Swan, Garrison, & Richardson, 2009). This 
processing is associated with the learning goals of learners. In other words, activiti es with different cognitive 
processing will affect the use of the MOOC online forum for learning. In sum, it is necessary to investigate how 
forum activities with different cognitive processing may influence student performance in MOOCs.","forums more than others (Cisel, 2014). These indicate that online forum activities can influence student

Purpose of the present study 
 
Our current study is similarly concerned with the effects of forum participation on student performance and 
learning, but it explores the problem from a different angle. Most recent MOOC studies did not take cognitive 
processing into account when examining forums activities. However, cognitive processing is very important for 
learners in open environments (Garrison et al., 2010). Therefore, this study aimed to explore learner behaviour 
in forums from a different perspective:  cognitive processing. Specifically, we investigated the effects of three 
discussion forum activities –  commenting, viewing,  and voting – on student peer review and academic 
performance in MOOCs. Commenting on other learners typically requires deeper thoug ht processing since a 
learner has to explicitly express her or his thoughts in words. On the other hand, viewing and voting, which 
involve reading, may require less cognitive processing. Specifically, we examined two types of samples: all 
forum participants (i.e., learners who commented, viewed, or voted at least once in the forums), and completing 
participants (i.e., learners who completed the course). We employed these two  samples to examine how the 
three forum activities might affect total quiz score s (academic performance) and the number of peer review 
submissions (peer learning). Peer review requires learners to submit feedback to other learners’ assignments. 
We used the number of peer review submissions as a proxy for peer learning because reading and writing the 
feedback benefits not only the student getting the feedback, but also the student giving it (van den Berg, 
Admiraal, & Pilot, 2006). Students whose work is reviewed benefit from getting external perspectives on ways 
to improve their work, thus stimulating their critical thinking (Paré & Joordens, 2008). Students performing the 
review also benefit because they may get ideas for improving their own work (Paré & Joordens, 2008). 
 
We hypothesised as follows: 
 
• (H1) Commenting will have a significant, positive effect on peer reviews.  
• (H2) Commenting will have a significant, positive effect on academic performance. 
• (H3) Viewing and voting will have significant, positive effects on peer reviews.  
• (H4) Viewing and voting will have significant, positive effects on academic performance. 
 
Dataset and participants  
 
The MOOC in this study was offered by a well-known private American university. The course was conducted 
in Coursera, which is a for -profit company founded in 2012 by two Stanford U niversity computer scientists 
who partnered with leading universities (Clarke, 2013). This non-credit-bearing course provided the chronology 
of 20th - and 21st -century American poetry and a way of understanding general cultural transitions from 
modernism to pos tmodernism. Learners did not need any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. The total 
duration of the course was 10 weeks. Each week participants were required to spend 5 to 10 hours to read some 
poems, view approximately 2 hours of video, participate in t he discussion forum (asynchronous), take quizzes 
and conduct peer reviews. The video lecture was a means of information transfer; the asynchronous discussion 
further facilitated deeper understanding; the quizzes assessed learner understanding; and the peer  reviews 
showed learner participatory level in peer learning. The instructor explicitly expressed that the discussion 
forums were very important by posting a statement in the introduction of the course outline. It was the only 
environment for learners to interact with the instructor and other learners by asking questions and getting other 
learners’ responses. Table 1 summarises the features of the MOOC.","Method

three forum activities might affect total quiz score s (academic performance) and the number of peer review 
submissions (peer learning). Peer review requires learners to submit feedback to other learners’ assignments. 
We used the number of peer review submissions as a proxy for peer learning because reading and writing the 
feedback benefits not only the student getting the feedback, but also the student giving it (van den Berg, 
Admiraal, & Pilot, 2006). Students whose work is reviewed benefit from getting external perspectives on ways 
to improve their work, thus stimulating their critical thinking (Paré & Joordens, 2008). Students performing the 
review also benefit because they may get ideas for improving their own work (Paré & Joordens, 2008). 
 
We hypothesised as follows: 
 
• (H1) Commenting will have a significant, positive effect on peer reviews.  
• (H2) Commenting will have a significant, positive effect on academic performance. 
• (H3) Viewing and voting will have significant, positive effects on peer reviews.  
• (H4) Viewing and voting will have significant, positive effects on academic performance. 
 
Dataset and participants  
 
The MOOC in this study was offered by a well-known private American university. The course was conducted 
in Coursera, which is a for -profit company founded in 2012 by two Stanford U niversity computer scientists 
who partnered with leading universities (Clarke, 2013). This non-credit-bearing course provided the chronology 
of 20th - and 21st -century American poetry and a way of understanding general cultural transitions from 
modernism to pos tmodernism. Learners did not need any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. The total 
duration of the course was 10 weeks. Each week participants were required to spend 5 to 10 hours to read some 
poems, view approximately 2 hours of video, participate in t he discussion forum (asynchronous), take quizzes 
and conduct peer reviews. The video lecture was a means of information transfer; the asynchronous discussion 
further facilitated deeper understanding; the quizzes assessed learner understanding; and the peer  reviews 
showed learner participatory level in peer learning. The instructor explicitly expressed that the discussion 
forums were very important by posting a statement in the introduction of the course outline. It was the only 
environment for learners to interact with the instructor and other learners by asking questions and getting other 
learners’ responses. Table 1 summarises the features of the MOOC."

hierarchical models are used to examine the contribut ions of predictors above and beyond previously entered 
predictors, that is, incremental validity. The order of the predictor variables is based on theory. These two 
models answer different questions. Since there is no well -recognised theory to understand the contributions of 
three MOOC discussion forum activities, this study  adopted an exploratory approach and used stepwise 
regression to anal yse the data. In the analysis, the number of peer reviews and total scores  in quizzes were 
dependent variables; and the number of posting, commenting, viewing, and voting were independent variables. 
The database had a lot of data that belonged to different groups, such as the instructor and testers. When we 
first retrieved the learner records, th ey showed that many learners did not use the MOOC forums. To increase 
the validity of the analyses, we cleared out the irrelevant data by excluding the data of learners who had never 
participated in the MOOC forum.  
 
Results  
 
In this study, total views is the total number of times that any learner had viewed threads (topics); total threads 
is the total number of topics in the forums; total votes  is the total number of votes cast in the forums; and total 
comments is the total number of comments across all posts. 
 
The asynchronous online discussion was assessed by the numbers of messages commented on or replied to in 
a thread, messages viewed (Cheng, Paré, Collimore, & Joordens, 2011; Harasim, 1993) and messages voted. 
Peer learning and performance were measured by the number of submitted peer reviews (Cheng et al., 2011) 
and the total scores in quizzes. We conducted stepwise linear regression analyses on peer reviews and total quiz 
scores as dependent variables.  
 
In the course, the total number of regis trations was 37,156. In the forums, total threads were 9202 and total 
comments were 47,984; and the total views and vote s were 510,853 and 7069 respectively. The mean of the 
total quiz score was 0.73 (SD = 3.89); the mean of submitted peer reviews was 0.10 (SD = 0.59). In this study, 
we employed two sample sets to conduct the analyses. The first sample set included all participants ( n = 1563) 
who participated in forum activities. The second sample set, a subset of the first, included participants who 
completed the course (n = 1185). We used these two sample sets to investigate how the four main MOOC forum 
activities affect peer reviews and quiz scores. Since asynchronous online discussion activities in such an open 
learning environment are under-studied by researchers, stepwise multiple linear regression was used to analyse 
the data (Menard, 2002). Due to the occurrence of type I errors, we used two sample data sets to cross-validate 
the results (Fox, 1991).

The number of participants was 1563; and no learners enrolled in the last week of the course. In the forums, the

the total scores of quizzes was 16.09 (SD = 10.01); the mean of submitted peer reviews was 2.36 ( SD = 1.66). 
Correlations between among all the variables were significant, all p  < 0.001 (Table 2). Positive correlations 
were found among each pair of dependent and independent variables –  dependent variables: total scor es and 
peer reviews; independent variables: commenting, posting, viewing and voting. Multicollinearity was checked 
and was well within accepted parameters (tolerance < 10.0 and VIF > 0.1; see Tables 3 and 4). Stepwise multiple

Discussion 
 
MOOCs provide massive numbers of learners with an open learning environment. In such a scenario, learners 
come from diverse backgrounds with different learning goals, and have no obligation to complete the course. 
The major factors influencing learners’ continuance of learning in MOOCs (Alraimi et al., 2015; Chen & Chen,"
2018 - Factors influencing peer learning and performance in MOOC asynchronous online discussion forum.pdf,"Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 2018, 34(4).   
 
 
24 
2015; Imlawi, Gregg, & Karimi, 2015) are different from those in traditional online courses. Hence, factors 
affecting the participatory level of MOOC forum activities could also be different. As asynchronous online 
discussion is one of the major interactive learning activities among instructors and learners, this study aimed to 
investigate the effect of common types of MOOC forum activities –  commenting, viewing and voting – on 
learners’ peer reviews and academic performance. In this study , the result s afford two implications, three 
explanations and five practical suggestions.  
 
The stepwise regression analysis conducted with all forum participants indicate s that viewing threads or 
comments are the main predictors of results in peer reviews and quiz scores, but the impact of viewing was 
suppressed somewhat by commenting when commenting and viewing  were introduced into the regression 
model. These findings suggest that viewing is more influential for conducting peer reviews and getting higher 
score in quizzes than commenting and voting. The full model (all factors) also indicates that among other forum 
activities, viewing and commenting are significantly related to peer reviews and total quiz scores, but not voting.  
 
A second stepwise regression analysis was conducted to investigate if the pattern of association of variables 
found in the first regression model with all participants could be replicated with those learners who participated 
in the forums and completed the course. The findings from the second analysis indicate a pattern of results that 
was similar but different in the strength of relationships. The analyses undertaken with the second sample set 
were similar, as viewing was still significant in predicting peer reviews and quiz scores, but with a stronger 
effect.  
 
In MOOC forums, commenting involves heavier cognitive processing and behavioural actions when compared 
to viewing. Learners who comment in forums are required to read and understand the messages before typing 
their responses. They probably revisited their responses for further actions. In contrast, learners who viewed 
and voted on messages are considered to have fewer actions. The degree of commenting to the forum discussion 
is also different between these two types of learners. The former one is more like a commenter, and the latter is 
a viewer. Therefore, two implications of the results from this study are that cognitive processing of activities 
affects MOOC learners learning, which is in line with the studies of Chiu and Churchill  (2015a, 2015b) and 
Chiu and Mok (2017) and learning activities should cater for both viewers and commenters in MOOCs.  
 
Three plausible explanations of these findings are learners’ study purpose, less obligated learners and voluntary 
forum participation. Behavioural intention to learn with MOOCs is different from that with formal courses 
(Alraimi et al., 2015). MOOC learners seek opportunities for self -learning and self -improvement ( Yousef, 
Chatti, Wosnitza, & Schroeder, 2015). MOOC learners continue to learn when they perceive the good reputation 
of the instructor  or institution, or when they find the educational resources useful and ready to be retrieved 
(Alraimi et al., 2015). They go online to retrieve the educational resources that they want for their own learning 
(Alraimi et al., 2015). Therefore, they intend to get information as quickly as possible for their convenience. In 
the forums, they would rather read (less cognitive processing) instead of responding as that will take longer.   
 
The second explanation is that MOOC learners are less obligated to complete the course.  In a formal course, 
learners know their classmates or instructor to  some degree through differen t contacts. For example, learners 
take more than one course with their peers; they work on a project together and they attend the same face-to 
face-classes. They build up their relationship through learning together in the same course. In contrast, MOOC 
learners hardly know their peers, and may only know their peers’ username, resulting in fewer peer effects (Xie, 
Ke, & Sharma, 2008). Less timely and appropriate feedback from peers also lowers learners’ intention to submit 
messages in the forum for discussion, that is,  posting and commenting. Similarly, the relationship between 
instructor and learners is another factor in keeping learners from participating in asynchronous discussion (Hew 
et al., 2010; Masters & Oberprieler, 2004; Vonderwell, 2003) in MOOCs. Due to the massive number of 
learners, instructors are less likely to give timely support or feedback to all the learners in a MOOC. This 
insufficient student support results in distant relationships (Imlawi et al., 2015), which are in line with the 
studies of Hew  et al. (2010), Masters and Oberprieler (2004), and Vonderwell (2003) on closed discussion. 
With these distant relationships, MOOCs, unlike formal courses, are  usually perceived as casual learning. The 
learners may have different personal reasons and only require m aking minimal efforts, apart from filling in 
registration forms, paying the tuition fee and getting enrolment permissions. Reasons for taking these actions","Asynchronous online 
discussion is one of the major interactive learning activities among instructors and learners, this study aimed to 
investigate the effect of common types of MOOC forum activities –  commenting, viewing and voting – on 
learners’ peer reviews and academic performance. In this study , the result s afford two implications, three 
explanations and five practical suggestions.  
 
The stepwise regression analysis conducted with all forum participants indicate s that viewing threads or 
comments are the main predictors of results in peer reviews and quiz scores, but the impact of viewing was 
suppressed somewhat by commenting when commenting and viewing  were introduced into the regression 
model. These findings suggest that viewing is more influential for conducting peer reviews and getting higher 
score in quizzes than commenting and voting. The full model (all factors) also indicates that among other forum 
activities, viewing and commenting are significantly related to peer reviews and total quiz scores, but not voting.  
 
A second stepwise regression analysis was conducted to investigate if the pattern of association of variables 
found in the first regression model with all participants could be replicated with those learners who participated 
in the forums and completed the course. The findings from the second analysis indicate a pattern of results that 
was similar but different in the strength of relationships. The analyses undertaken with the second sample set 
were similar, as viewing was still significant in predicting peer reviews and quiz scores, but with a stronger 
effect.  
 
In MOOC forums, commenting involves heavier cognitive processing and behavioural actions when compared 
to viewing. Learners who comment in forums are required to read and understand the messages before typing 
their responses. They probably revisited their responses for further actions. In contrast, learners who viewed 
and voted on messages are considered to have fewer actions. The degree of commenting to the forum discussion 
is also different between these two types of learners. The former one is more like a commenter, and the latter is 
a viewer. Therefore, two implications of the results from this study are that cognitive processing of activities 
affects MOOC learners learning, which is in line with the studies of Chiu and Churchill  (2015a, 2015b) and 
Chiu and Mok (2017) and learning activities should cater for both viewers and commenters in MOOCs.  
 
Three plausible explanations of these findings are learners’ study purpose, less obligated learners and voluntary 
forum participation. Behavioural intention to learn with MOOCs is different from that with formal courses 
(Alraimi et al., 2015). MOOC learners seek opportunities for self -learning and self -improvement ( Yousef, 
Chatti, Wosnitza, & Schroeder, 2015). MOOC learners continue to learn when they perceive the good reputation 
of the instructor  or institution, or when they find the educational resources useful and ready to be retrieved 
(Alraimi et al., 2015). They go online to retrieve the educational resources that they want for their own learning 
(Alraimi et al., 2015). Therefore, they intend to get information as quickly as possible for their convenience. In 
the forums, they would rather read (less cognitive processing) instead of responding as that will take longer.   
 
The second explanation is that MOOC learners are less obligated to complete the course.  In a formal course, 
learners know their classmates or instructor to  some degree through differen t contacts. For example, learners 
take more than one course with their peers; they work on a project together and they attend the same face-to 
face-classes. They build up their relationship through learning together in the same course. In contrast, MOOC 
learners hardly know their peers, and may only know their peers’ username, resulting in fewer peer effects (Xie,

could be exploring interest i n a topic and assessing additional resources for their formal studies (Onah et al, 
2014; Yang et al., 2015). Therefore, MOOC learners might not fully engage in learning. In traditional courses, 
learners invest more in learning when they want to get a better grade and/or get their work recognised by peers 
or instructors. Therefore, in a MOOC learning environment, some learners like to participate in the learning as 
viewers rather than as commenters. 
 
Another explanation is that learning with MOOC forums is not perceived as compulsory. The learners are not 
under any instructor supervision or monitoring during learning. They are not reminded personally to complete 
the tasks when they fail to complete the  forum activities as scheduled.  Learners are not strictly required to 
participate in the discussion topic proposed by instructors or to respond to the messages posted by peers. They 
participate in the forum based on their own interests rather than the course requirements. On the other hand, in 
traditional online courses, forums could be used as part of the assessment, as recommended and encouraged by 
many studies (Dennen, 2005; Mazzolini & Maddison, 2007).  
 
However, it is important to note that these explanations do not diminish the influential role of commenting in 
predicting learner peer reviews and quiz scores. The findings suggest that commenting is still one of the 
significant factors influencing participation and performance.  
 
Conclusion and limitations 
 
In most MOOCs, video lectures and discussion forums are common instructional strategies used to engage 
student learning (Hew & Cheung, 2014) . Although the use of forums in closed learning environments is well 
studied, the examination of forums in MOOCs remains unclear (Hew & Cheung, 2014). 
 
The major finding of this study suggests that besides commenting, viewing is one of major factors influencing 
learning in MOOCs; however, only a few studies mention how to encourage viewing. Accordingly, we provide 
five practical suggestions to facilitate viewing. First, due to the massive number of threads in forums, we should 
use attractive and short title s for threads or signal keywords in threads ( Chiu & Churchill , 2015a, 2015b; 
signalling principle in Mayer, 20 09). Second, as concise messages can promote responding and reading, we 
should encourage short and simple comments from learners by restricting the number of words in a response. 
Third, we should highlight important messages in the comments or summar ise the comments on a daily basis 
for newsfeeds. This suggestion can help busy MOOC learners to receive summar ies without going through all 
the messages. Fourth, a picture contain ing a lot of words can transfer messages to learner s more effectively; 
besides, some learners learn better with images. MOOC instructors should use images to present the main idea 
of threads. Fifth, we should learners to popular forum messages, that is, the messages learners read or responded 
to most. This suggestion encourages peer learning by reading other learners’ messages. 
 
There are a number of limitations in this study , three of which are noted here. Firstly, although  this study the 
found that participation  and performance are primarily predicted by viewing and to a lesser extent by 
commenting, more studies are needed to validate the finding. The results of the present study could also be 
extended by additional studies on other MOOCs in other subject domains (Chiu & Churchill, 2016). Secondly, 
this study did not consider a nother major learning activity – watching video lectures – and outcomes that are 
measured in different phases. Future research should be conducted using longitudinal design, including learning 
time. Thirdly, learners’ backgrounds, such as educational level , age and study purposes , were not considered; 
these factors could also influence participation  in forum discussions. Accordingly, future research on MOOC 
forum activities should include more factors – cognitive processing of activities and interactions among learners 
– and should compare humanity and art with science and engineering learners.
