education system in the United States and provide 
improved schooling experiences for vulnerable children, 
enrollment in private schools, largely through voucher or tax-
credit financing, has been among the most frequently referenced 
as well as contentious (e.g., Dynarski, 2016; Lubienski & 
Lubienski, 2013; Urquiola, 2016). Policies and financing 
schemes that encourage enrollment in private schooling have 
been justified on the basis of increasing choice for low-income 
parents that cannot relocate to more affluent and better school 
districts, as a means of increasing pressure on public schools to 
compete in a market for parents’ selection, and as a remedy for 
the achievement gap, presumably because of the superior capac-
ity of private schools to educate (poor) students. Many of these 
same arguments are made in support of expanded charter 
schools, which bear similarities with private school programs 
(greater flexibility in hiring or curricula) but tend to be subject 
to greater oversight, with most charters considered public schools 
in some form (Carpenter, Keith, & Catt, 2016; Levchenko &

At the core of these justifications for reforms that utilize 
schools outside of the typical K–12 governance and operational 
structures is the assumption that private schools are more effec-

decreasing risky behavior (Dynarski, 2016; Flanders &

achievement (Pianta, Belsky, Vandergrift, Houts, & Morrison, 
2008) as well as associations between experiences in child care 
prior to school entry and high school performance outcomes 
(Vandell, Burchinal, & Pierce, 2016). Because of its longitudinal 
nature and assessment of a broad range of outcomes, the use of 
the SECCYD data set in this study may add a unique and rele-
vant perspective to consideration of recent federal policy initia-
tives to increase financial support through vouchers and tax 
credits for families to enroll their children in private schools.
Literature Review
By and large, the evidence on the impact of school voucher pro-
grams casts doubt on any clear conclusion that private schools are 
superior in producing student performance (e.g., Abdulkadiroglu, 
Pathak, & Walters, 2015; Berends & Waddington, in press; 
Carolson, Chingos, & Campbell, 2017; DeAngelis & Burke 
2017; Figlio & Karbowinc, 2016; Lubienski & Lubiekski, 2013; 
Mills & Wolf, 2017). In separate and well-controlled studies that 
typically rely on a lottery-type design to control for differences in 
family background and other factors often implicated in both 
school outcomes and enrollment into private or public education, 
independent investigations of programs in Ohio, Louisiana, 
Indiana, and New York City indicate that enrollment in private 
schools had mixed effects on achievement for low-income stu-
dents compared with program-eligible peers not attending private 
schools. These studies, designed to support causal inferences 
regarding the impacts of private schooling, are among the stron-
gest scientific examinations of such effects.
Dynarski (2016) summarized recent evaluations of voucher 
program impacts, noting the appearance of large negative 
impacts on student achievement, particulary in the early years of 
the program or for the first year or two in which a student is 
enrolled. For example, in the first years of the Louisiana voucher 
program, for a public school student who was average in math 
and began attending a private school using a voucher, their 
achievement scores declined by 16 percentile points after one 
year, a finding that was consistent across grades and subject areas 
(Abdulkadiroglu et al., 2015). In Indiana, the decline for the 
average student, again in the first one to two years of private 
enrollment, was 6 percentile points in math (Berends & 
Waddinton, in press). Similarly, in an evaluation of the Ohio 
voucher program, Figlio and Karbowinc (2016) reported that 
students who used vouchers to attend private schools performed 
worse academically in math and language arts compared with 
closely matched peers attending public schools.
However, subsequent examinations of Louisiana and Indiana 
students who remained enrolled in private schools longer than 
the initial one- to two-year evaluations showed those students’ 
performance to be superior to their peers in public schools (Mills 
& Wolf, 2017), indicating that length of student enrollment in 
private education may be a key feature influencing any benefits 
accrued. And in New York City and Washington, D.C., the 
results of lottery assignment evaluations were more positive, 
with an uptick in graduation rates and college attendance, higher 
reading and math scores for Black students in New York City, 
and higher reading scores in the third follow-up year of the D.C. 
program (for a summary, see Dynarksi, 2016). So in causal 
inference studies, although there are indications that the early 
years of a program (e.g., in Louisiana) and short-term enroll-
ment in private schooling (e.g., for Ohio, Indiana, and Louisiana) 
pose a degree of risk for lowering students’ achievement, there is 
also indication that when poor students are enrolled for longer 
periods in more mature programs, performance is at or above 
publicly enrolled control groups.
In a follow-up evaluation of schools in the Louisiana program, 
Abdulkadiroglu et al. (2015) attributed the reduced academic 
achievement in math, reading, science, and social studies to the pool 
of private schools available in the first years of the voucher program. 
Participating private schools charged lower tuition than other pri-
vate schools and showed declining enrollment rates, suggesting that 
participation was a strategy to boost enrollment in financially weak 
private schools. Thus, in the first years, low-income parents were 
only able to select from low-quality private schools, replicating the 
income stratification in school quality that voucher programs are 
designed and touted to disrupt. As the program in Louisiana 
matured, evidence showed that the available pool of private schools 
accepting vouchers was composed of a larger number of higher per-
forming schools (Abdulkadiroglu et al., 2015). Whether the uptick 
in performance associated with this program is a result of improve-
ments in the low-performing privates, stable and longer term enroll-
ment of poor children in their new private schools, or some other 
factors remains to be seen.
Berends and Waddington (in press) also examined the Indiana 
program to evaluate the extent to which the type of private 
school may be part of the reason why negative impacts were ini-
tially reported for that state’s voucher program. This research 
team analyzed data longitudinally across Grades 3 through 8 in 
Indianapolis to identify impacts associated with public school 
students enrolling in a charter, magnet, Catholic, or other pri-
vate schools. Although not a lottery or experimental design, the 
analytic approach examined school type as it related to individ-
ual student learning performance over time. Students showed 
modest gains when switching to a charter and modest losses 
(between .09 and .18 standard deviation units) when transfer-
ring to a magnet or Catholic school. The authors point out that 
the evidence suggests that non–public schools can be highly vari-
able within any specific catchment area and, as in the Louisiana 
studies, the quality of the pool of available schools is critical to 
the success of voucher programs as a means to address achieve-
ment or opportunity disparities.
Using a nonexperimental design and analytic approach to 
evaluate private schooling effects, Wong, Cook, and Steiner 
(2009) used data from the National Assessment of Education 
Progress (NAEP) to compare public schools to private schools 
from the 1990s into the 2000s. At the start of this epoch, private 
schools on average started with higher scores, but a decade later, 
that gap had closed significantly, largely due to public schools’ 
improvements, especially in math. The authors concluded that 
the accountability provisions of No Child Left Behind focused 
public school efforts in ways that improved test scores and that it 
also might be possible that factors such as competition (with 
charters, homeschooling, or privates) also exerted an influence 
on public schools such that they focused more intently on 
instruction and student outcomes (a finding suggested by Figlio 
& Karbownic, 2016, in their evaluation of the Ohio voucher","achievement (Pianta, Belsky, Vandergrift, Houts, & Morrison, 
2008) as well as associations between experiences in child care 
prior to school entry and high school performance outcomes 
(Vandell, Burchinal, & Pierce, 2016). Because of its longitudinal 
nature and assessment of a broad range of outcomes, the use of 
the SECCYD data set in this study may add a unique and rele-

program in which achievement in public schools rose as a func-
tion of the voucher program). With data from NAEP and the 
Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS), Lubienski and 
Lubienski (2013) also find that differences in student perfor-
mance outcomes appear to favor private school attendance, but 
once student and family demographics are considered, no such 
benefits are apparent, and in fact, the analyses suggest public 
schools appear superior in some ways. Again, these national-level 
analyses using NAEP or ECLS do not support causal inferences; 
nonetheless, the results from these data do not contradict the 
mixed evidence from experimental studies.
Private schools also represent a considerable proportion of the 
education sector in many developing countries and internation-
ally more generally, and research from non-U.S. schools may also 
be relevant to understand the impacts and implementations of 
private schooling. Most of these studies are not experimental in 
nature, and selection effects are addressed through statistical 
methods. For example, Sakellariou (2016) used results from the 
2012 administration of the PISA tests to examine private school 
effects on mathematics performance for students in 40 different 
countries. Using separate methods to adjust for selection bias 
and peer effects, a private school advantage was detected in a 
small minority of countries, with the majority of countries’ 
results being null or negative. In contrast, Shakeel (2017) took a 
longer term perspective in estimating the effects on PISA of pri-
vate schooling for 62 countries across the period of 2000 to 
2012, controlling for selection bias by examining patterns of 
scores over time (using year and country fixed effects) and using 
an estimate of demand for schooling within a country and year 
as an instrument for private share of schooling enrollment. Using 
this analytic approach, evidence suggests that increases in private 
schooling led to improvements in PISA scores, on average, across 
all countries included. Moreover, estimates suggest that a 10 per-
centage point increase in the share of private school enrollment 
was associated with 28% of a standard deviation increase in 
math, 24% of a standard deviation increase in reading, and 18% 
of a standard deviation increase in science. Thus, the evidence 
from international studies is also mixed, showing both positive 
and negative effects, with suggestions that impacts are moder-
ated both by the heterogeneity of the private school pool as well 
as the length of time that programs are in place.
There are a number of important considerations to keep in 
mind when interpreting results from the available well- 
controlled studies of voucher-like programs or evaluations of private 
school attendance. First, there is overwhelming evidence that 
household factors such as income and parent education drive 
selection and enrollment in private school. Higher income fami-
lies can afford private school tuition and will choose schools that 
match an assortment of goals and values they hold for their chil-
dren, including achievement, social adjustment, access to peer 
networks, and character (Levchenko & Haidoura, 2016). Or in 
the case of religious schools, income may play a somewhat less 
prominent role in selection, but alignment with values and cur-
ricular focus can be the determining factor for parents. Of note, 
these aspects of family background (income, education, expecta-
tions) are also implicated in stimulation and opportunity that 
drives children’s learning and achievement. In this way, studies 
must try to separate the effects of private schooling per se from 
the family background factors that determine both enrollment 
in private school and children’s achievement. Some studies 
achieve a level of control using randomized designs mostly 
embedded in lottery-type application processes, while others use 
quasi-experimental statistical modeling to estimate schooling 
effects net of assessed selection factors. As noted previously, how-
ever, the results from both experimental and quasi-experimental 
studies are mixed.
A second consideration in evaluating private school effects is 
the exceptionally wide variation in private schooling across the 
United States (Carpenter et al., 2016; Levchenko & Haidoura, 
2016; Redford, Battle, & Bielick, 2016; Urquiola, 2016). Private 
schools encompass those that include various religious denomi-
nations and those with a specialized curriculum (e.g., Montessori, 
Waldorf), and the auspices under which they operate range from 
highly institutionalized and systemic (e.g., the Archdiocese of 
New York) to highly localized and small units. Evidence also sug-
gests that urban and rural locations may have differential conse-
quences for accessibility and enrollment in private schools 
(Carpenter et al., 2016). Moreover, governance, staff qualifica-
tions, and school size are also among the features of private 
schooling that are highly varied. Thus, when studying the cate-
gory of private schooling as a policy choice, it is important to 
keep in mind the exceptional degree of heterogeneity in the sec-
tor, which on the one hand is often viewed as a desirable charac-
teristic (by reformers, advocates, and parent) but as seen in a 
number of evaluations, has variable results on students.
Third, most well-controlled evaluations of voucher programs 
or private school enrollment tend to utilize outcome assessments 
in the domains of math and language arts (reading) available 
from the state standardized testing programs (e.g., Dynarski, 
2016) or national assessments such as NAEP . Notably, although 
these assessments provide valuable information, they do not 
enable the detection of impacts on other desirable student out-
comes, such as motivation, social adjustment, and behavior, 
which are often included in the rationale for private school 
enrollment and superiority (Carpenter et al., 2016; Lubienski & 
Lubienski, 2013; Urquiola, 2016). Relatedly, most of these pro-
grams have been in place or have outcome data available for only 
a short number of years, and so the longer term nature of any 
private schooling effects have not yet been identified or included 
in the research literature; a longitudinal analytic and temporal 
frame that extends from elementary through high school may 
illuminate effects not readily apparent in shorter timeframe 
analyses.
The Current Study
In the present study, we take advantage of a unique longitudinal 
study of a large and diverse sample of children to examine the 
extent to which enrollment in private schools is predictive of 
achievement and social and personal outcomes at age 15 for stu-
dents enrolled in the NICHD SECCYD. The SECCYD offers a 
unique opportunity to examine private schooling effects with its 
comprehensive assessment of student outcomes at multiple 
intervals, a timeframe that is much longer than typical evalua-
tions of private schooling, and the detailed and wide-ranging 
assessments of family background and contextual processes that","program in which achievement in public schools rose as a func-
tion of the voucher program). With data from NAEP and the 
Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS), Lubienski and 
Lubienski (2013) also find that differences in student perfor-
mance outcomes appear to favor private school attendance, but 
once student and family demographics are considered, no such 
benefits are apparent, and in fact, the analyses suggest public 
schools appear superior in some ways. Again, these national-level 
analyses using NAEP or ECLS do not support causal inferences; 
nonetheless, the results from these data do not contradict the 
mixed evidence from experimental studies.
Private schools also represent a considerable proportion of the 
education sector in many developing countries and internation-
ally more generally, and research from non-U.S. schools may also 
be relevant to understand the impacts and implementations of 
private schooling. Most of these studies are not experimental in 
nature, and selection effects are addressed through statistical 
methods. For example, Sakellariou (2016) used results from the 
2012 administration of the PISA tests to examine private school 
effects on mathematics performance for students in 40 different 
countries. Using separate methods to adjust for selection bias 
and peer effects, a private school advantage was detected in a 
small minority of countries, with the majority of countries’ 
results being null or negative. In contrast, Shakeel (2017) took a 
longer term perspective in estimating the effects on PISA of pri-
vate schooling for 62 countries across the period of 2000 to 
2012, controlling for selection bias by examining patterns of 
scores over time (using year and country fixed effects) and using 
an estimate of demand for schooling within a country and year 
as an instrument for private share of schooling enrollment. Using 
this analytic approach, evidence suggests that increases in private 
schooling led to improvements in PISA scores, on average, across 
all countries included. Moreover, estimates suggest that a 10 per-
centage point increase in the share of private school enrollment 
was associated with 28% of a standard deviation increase in 
math, 24% of a standard deviation increase in reading, and 18% 
of a standard deviation increase in science. Thus, the evidence 
from international studies is also mixed, showing both positive 
and negative effects, with suggestions that impacts are moder-
ated both by the heterogeneity of the private school pool as well 
as the length of time that programs are in place.

effects net of assessed selection factors. As noted previously, how-
ever, the results from both experimental and quasi-experimental 
studies are mixed.
A second consideration in evaluating private school effects is 
the exceptionally wide variation in private schooling across the 
United States (Carpenter et al., 2016; Levchenko & Haidoura, 
2016; Redford, Battle, & Bielick, 2016; Urquiola, 2016). Private 
schools encompass those that include various religious denomi-
nations and those with a specialized curriculum (e.g., Montessori, 
Waldorf), and the auspices under which they operate range from 
highly institutionalized and systemic (e.g., the Archdiocese of 
New York) to highly localized and small units. Evidence also sug-
gests that urban and rural locations may have differential conse-
quences for accessibility and enrollment in private schools 
(Carpenter et al., 2016). Moreover, governance, staff qualifica-
tions, and school size are also among the features of private 
schooling that are highly varied. Thus, when studying the cate-
gory of private schooling as a policy choice, it is important to 
keep in mind the exceptional degree of heterogeneity in the sec-
tor, which on the one hand is often viewed as a desirable charac-
teristic (by reformers, advocates, and parent) but as seen in a 
number of evaluations, has variable results on students.
Third, most well-controlled evaluations of voucher programs 
or private school enrollment tend to utilize outcome assessments 
in the domains of math and language arts (reading) available 
from the state standardized testing programs (e.g., Dynarski, 
2016) or national assessments such as NAEP . Notably, although 
these assessments provide valuable information, they do not 
enable the detection of impacts on other desirable student out-
comes, such as motivation, social adjustment, and behavior, 
which are often included in the rationale for private school 
enrollment and superiority (Carpenter et al., 2016; Lubienski & 
Lubienski, 2013; Urquiola, 2016). Relatedly, most of these pro-
grams have been in place or have outcome data available for only 
a short number of years, and so the longer term nature of any 
private schooling effects have not yet been identified or included 
in the research literature; a longitudinal analytic and temporal 
frame that extends from elementary through high school may 
illuminate effects not readily apparent in shorter timeframe 
analyses.
The Current Study
In the present study, we take advantage of a unique longitudinal 
study of a large and diverse sample of children to examine the 
extent to which enrollment in private schools is predictive of 
achievement and social and personal outcomes at age 15 for stu-
dents enrolled in the NICHD SECCYD. The SECCYD offers a 
unique opportunity to examine private schooling effects with its 
comprehensive assessment of student outcomes at multiple 
intervals, a timeframe that is much longer than typical evalua-
tions of private schooling, and the detailed and wide-ranging 
assessments of family background and contextual processes that"

can help in estimating (and reducing) selection bias, as has been 
done in the study’s evaluation of other policy-relevant factors, 
such as enrollment in child care or teacher quality (e.g., Belsky  
et al., 2007; Pianta et al., 2008; Vandell, Belsky, Burchinal, 
Steinberg, & Vandergrift, 2010; Vandell et al., 2016). And the 
SECCYD sample reflects a broad range of economic conditions, 
cultural beliefs, and childrearing practices, such as is the case in 
the United States. In sum, this study aims to evaluate the bene-
fits of private school enrollment on a comprehensive set of stu-
dent outcomes assessed in adolescence. We also consider the 
extent to which the the benefits of private school enrollment 
vary for children across the income distribution and children in 
urban and rural communities.
Method
Participants
The NICHD SECCYD is a multisite research project originally 
designed to determine the benefits of early child care on chil-
dren’s development. Participants were recruited in 1991 from 
designated community hospitals at 10 university-based data col-
lection sites: (1) Little Rock, Arkansas; (2) Irvine, California; (3) 
Lawrence, Kansas; (4) Boston, Massachusetts; (5) Philadelphia 
and (6) Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; (7) Charlottesville, Virginia; 
(8) Seattle, Washington; (9) Hickory and Morganton, North 
Carolina; and (10) Madison, Wisconsin. Recruitment and selec-
tion procedures are described in detail (NICHD ECCRN, 
2001), and study procedures are described on the study website 
(http://secc.rti.org). Children were followed from birth to 15 
years with a common study protocol, including interview and 
home, school, and neighborhood observations that occurred on 
a yearly basis. For all study data collection protocols, human 
subjects institutional review boards at each university and the 
data coordinating center approved voluntary, written informed 
consents from participating families.
Healthy newborns, discharged within one week of birth, of 
English-speaking mothers were recruited. When the target child 
was 2 weeks old, attempts were made to contact 3,015 families 
who met eligibility criteria to enlist their participation. Attempts 
to contact were unsuccessful for 512 families, and 151 families 
were deemed ineligible because the child remained in the hospi-
tal more than seven days or the family planned to move. An 
additional 641 families refused to participate, and 1-month 
interviews could not be scheduled for 185 families for other rea-
sons. Out of 1,526 families scheduled, 1,364 families actually 
completed the 1-month home visit and became study partici-
pants. The resulting sample included (nonexclusively) 24% chil-
dren of color, 15% single mothers, and 10% mothers without a 
high school diploma. At the 1-month home visit, mothers had 
an average of 14.23 years of education, and the average family 
income was 2.86 times the poverty threshold. There were no 
significant differences between these 1,364 families and the U.S. 
population (U.S. Census Bureau, 1990) based on ethnicity 
(80.3% White in U.S. population vs. 80.4% in cohort) and 
household income (household income information available on 
1,271 families; $36,520 in U.S. population and $37,781 in 
cohort). However, the NICHD SECCYD cohort (missing 
marital status for 2 mothers) had a slightly higher percentage of 
parents who were married than the U.S. population (76.7% vs. 
74.2%, p = .04).
Of the original 1,364 study participants, 1,226 participated 
in Phase II (through first grade; 1995–1999), 1,061 participated 
in Phase III (through sixth grade; 2000–2004), and 1,009 par-
ticipated in Phase IV of the study (through ninth grade; 2005–
2007). And of the 1,364 children who were originally enrolled 
into the study, we: (a) excluded 207 children who had no record 
of school type between kindergarten and ninth grade and (b) 60 
children who were ever homeschooled or ever enrolled in a pub-
lic charter school. For sample descriptives for the 1,097 study 
children who made up our analytic sample, see Table 1.
Measures and Procedures
School sector. Through administrative archives from schools, we 
had access to students’ school enrollment records for each year 
between kindergarten and ninth grade (all 10 sites had public 
school kindergarten). These school records were used to measure 
students’exposure to public and private school education in two dif-
ferent ways. Before discussing these two measures, it is important 
to note that for the purposes of the current investigation, children 
were allowed to have missing data on the school type variable over 
time in order to maximize the focal predictor (i.e., children were 
included if they had missing data at later waves on school type). 
On average, children had information on school sector available for 
8.81 years (SD = 2.25) of the 10 years of study participation, and 
approximately 90% of children had at least six years of school type 
data. Roughly 7% to 17% of children had missing data for these 
measures at any given wave (7%, 13%, 17%, 7%, 9%, 12%, 12%, 
11%, 13%, and 16% had missing data on school type in kindergar-
ten and first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and 
ninth grades, respectively). However, as discussed earlier, because of 
our sample inclusion requirements, all 1,097 children had at least 
one wave of data on school type.
With the aforementioned information in mind, we first mea-
sured any exposure to private school education (0 = no, 1 = yes ), 
which captured in binary form whether participants ever 
attended a private school during their first 10 years of formal 
schooling. Second, we measured the number of years partici-
pants attended a private school. T o create this indicator of years, 
we multiplied the proportion of waves children experienced pri-
vate school by 10 (i.e., the years of data collection between kin-
dergarten and ninth grade). As a precaution, we also estimated 
models that included an analytic weight that contained the 
number of years of data for which children had school type data. 
In doing so, children who had more data points received greater 
weight than children who had fewer data points (results dis-
cussed in more detail in the following).
Ninth-grade outcomes. Adolescents’ school performance and 
functioning in ninth grade was based on a variety of benchmarks 
collected through direct assessments, administrative records, self-
report, and/or parent report (see Table 2 for descriptives). School 
records were pulled at the end of the year, and direct assessments 
and self- and parent reports generally occurred during the spring 
of the school year or right after the completion of ninth grade.","Method

Academic achievement and educational aspirations. T o begin, adolescents’ 
cognitive skills (Picture Vocabulary, alpha = 0.81), literacy achievement 
(Passage Comprehension, alpha = 0.81), and math achievement (Applied 
Problems, alpha = 0.87) were directly assessed with subtests from the 
Woodcock-Johnson Educational Battery–Revised (Woodcock & John-
son, 1989). Student’s working memory was also directly assessed with 
the Operation Span Task (OSPAN; T urner & Engle, 1989), which 
required that they complete a series of arithmetic problems, remember 
a list of letters, and then do these tasks at the same time.
Through administrative records, we also had access to stu-
dents overall grade point average at the end of ninth grade along 
with their math coursework (0 = no math course, 1= below 
Algebra I, 2 = Algebra I, 3 = geometry, 4 = Algebra II, and 5=

ing behavior problems (33 items that captured delinquent and 
aggressive behavior; alpha = .91), internalizing behavior problems 
(31 items that captured withdrawn, somatic complaints, and 
anxious/depressed behavior; alpha = 0.86), and social skills (40 
items that captured cooperation, assertiveness, responsibility, 
and self-control; alpha = 0.91) with the Child Behavior Check-
list and the Social Skills Rating System, which were both based on a 3-point 
Likert scale (0 = never or not true, 2 = very often or very true).
Adolescents also used an audio computer-assisted self-interview 
to respond to a series of questions about risk taking over the 
course of the past year (0 = never, 2 = never more than once), 
which captured sexual risk taking (e.g., had sexual intercourse, 
diagnosed with an STD; 4 items; alpha =.58), other risky behav-
ior (e.g., gotten into fights, drank, smoked; 36 items; alpha = 
.87), and victimization (e.g., been injured, harassed, mugged; 15

items; alpha = .76). For each measure of risk taking, we top 
coded the top 2% to 3% of responses to address issues of skew. 
Finally, students used the Future Outlook Inventory (1 = never 
to 4 = always; alpha = 0.72; Cauffman & Woolard, 1999) to 
respond to eight questions that captured their future outlook, 
which tapped into their ability to consider the longer term con-
sequences and implications for others as a result of their 
decisions.
Covariates. T o address concerns of omitted variable bias and 
reduce the possibility of spurious associations, our multivariate 
models adjust for a large number of covariates. It is important 
to note that for all time-varying factors, we take the average of 
children’s and families’ experiences during early childhood when 
children were 6, 15, 24, 36, and 54 months of age (unless other-
wise noted). We discuss these covariates in blocks, but in general, 
these covariates reflect the measurement of a large and substan-
tial set of factors implicated in possible selection bias relative to 
estimating private school effects.
Family characteristics. Our first block of covariates taps into fam-
ilies’ capacity and resources, namely: mothers’ age and years of 
education at birth of child, mothers’ psychological adjustment 
at 6 months of age (measured with the NEO Personality Inven-
tory; Costa & McCrae, 1985), mothers’ vocabulary skills at 36 
months of age (measured with the Peabody Picture Vocabu-
lary T est–Revised; Dunn & Dunn, 1981), parenting quality 
(measured with the Home Observation for Measurement of 
the Environment Scale, Caldwell & Bradley, 1984; and video-
taped interactions that captured maternal sensitivity), household 
income-to-needs ratio, maternal employment, maternal depres-
sive symptoms (measured with the Center for Epidemiological 
Studies Depression Scale; Radloff, 1977), and an indicator of 
whether children lived in a two-parent household.
Child characteristics. Our next block of covariates taps into chil-
dren’s own characteristics and experiences before kindergarten 
entry, which are likely correlated both with their later school per-
formance and their parents’ school choice. More specifically, at 
the child level, our statistical models adjust for: gender, race/eth-
nicity, birthweight, birth order, and temperament at 36 months 
of age (measured with the Infant T emperament Questionnaire; 
Medoff-Cooper, Carey, & McDevitt, 1993). As part of the 
child-level characteristics, we also adjust for student’s academic 
achievement, working memory, and social-behavioral function-
ing as measured at 54 months of age, which is recognized as one 
of the strongest adjustments for omitted variable bias (NICHD 
ECCRN & Duncan, 2003). In addition to these characteristics 
of children themselves, we also control for children’s early edu-
cation experiences between 6 and 54 months of age, including 
the proportion of time spent in center care, proportion of time 
spent in maternal care, and child care quality (as measured with 
Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment).
Neighborhood characteristics. Because there is likely to be geographic 
heterogeneity in private school offerings and access, we also  
controlled for a rich set of neighborhood characteristics. More 
specifically, through census data, we had access to block group data 
for children’s neighborhoods at 1, 15, 36, and 54 months of age, 
which we averaged together to capture neighborhood characteris-
tics during the early childhood epoch. These variables include the 
percent of: households in poverty, single-parent households, house-
holds receiving government assistance, unemployed adults, adults 
with less than a high school education, and nonminority adults. As 
part of the neighborhood characteristics, we also adjusted for site 
fixed (i.e., Boston, Charlottesville, etc.), which captured the broader 
differences across communities.
Analytic plan. All analyses were estimated within the Stata pro-
gram (StatCorp, 2009). T o address missing data, we imputed 50 
data sets via chained equations, and our focal research objectives 
were addressed within an ordinary least squares regression frame-
work. Although two of our outcomes might best be thought of 
as ordinal categorical variables (i.e., math and science course-
work), for simplicity, we specify all outcomes as continuous. 
As a precaution, however, we estimated parallel ordered logistic 
regression models for these two outcomes, and all conclusions 
were the same as those presented in the following (results avail-
able from authors).
Within this general framework, we estimated a series of 
regression models in stages to demonstrate the influence of 
covariate adjustments on the simple bivariate (and likely biased) 
“effects” of private school enrollment. First, we begin with sim-
ple bivariate models (Models 1), which do not adjust for other 
factors that may be related to children’s school performance and 
their enrollment in public as compared with private schools. We 
then estimate a series of models that iteratively include different 
sets of covariates. In the first set of adjusted models (Models 2), 
we include family characteristics. In the second set of adjusted 
models, we add child characteristics and experiences during early 
childhood (Models 3), and then we include neighborhood char-
acteristics and site fixed effects (Models 4).
Although our primary model specification corresponds to 
Model 4, we test an additional set of models that includes covari-
ates that capture family (parenting quality, income-to-needs 
ratio, proportion of mothers employed, maternal depression, 
and two-parent household) and neighborhood characteristics 
during middle childhood (a composite of first, third, and fifth 
grades) and adolescence (ninth grade) as a means of providing a 
more conservative estimate of the associations between school 
experiences and adolescent outcomes. It is important to note 
that if private school enrollment is associated with the covariates 
during the later years (i.e., during middle childhood and adoles-
cence), then their inclusion in the model might result in a biased 
estimate for private school enrollment. We nonetheless estimate 
these alternative models given the 10-year window for private 
school enrollment and to ensure that our findings are robust to 
various possible specifications.
With regard to whether private or public school is superior 
for certain children, we look at the experiences of lower income 
students and students in rural versus urban communities. T o 
assess for heterogeneity across the income distribution, we recode 
our income variable to demarcate children and families who 
were: (a) at or below 300% of the federal poverty line (FPL)","items; alpha = .76). For each measure of risk taking, we top 
coded the top 2% to 3% of responses to address issues of skew. 
Finally, students used the Future Outlook Inventory (1 = never 
to 4 = always; alpha = 0.72; Cauffman & Woolard, 1999) to

during the early childhood years (mean income-to-needs ratio of 
1.76, SD = 0.75) and (b) those whose income-to-needs ratio 
exceeded 300% of the FPL (mean income-to-needs ratio of 
5.65, SD = 2.84). We also tested continuous income by private 
school enrollment interactions and considered different income 
groupings (i.e., at or below 225% of the FPL; 225%–450% of 
the FPL; greater than 450% of the FPL), and in each case, our 
results were the same as those presented in the following. Finally, 
to capture heterogeneity as a function of urbanicity, we grouped 
the 10 study sites into either rural (39% of students) or urban 
(61% of students) locations. In the following analyses, we pres-
ent a within-group examination of the benefits of private school 
enrollment (i.e., we estimate the benefits of private school enroll-
ment within the different groups), and interaction terms were 
entered into full sample regressions to formally test for the mod-
eration. It is important to note that these models that capture 
heterogeneity in the associations between private school enroll-
ment and ninth-grade functioning correspond to the Model 4 
specification outlined previously and adjust for child, family, 
and neighborhood factors derived from the early childhood years 
(but omit income or site, depending on the moderator).
Results
We begin with a brief descriptive portrait of private school enroll-
ment rates in the NICHD SECCYD. Then, we present bivariate 
and multivariate models that illustrate the differences in students’ 
ninth-grade outcomes as a function of school type. T o begin, 
roughly 14% to 23% of students attended a private school between 
kindergarten and ninth grade, and 31% attended a private school 
for at least one year (see Table 3). We also find that across the first 10 
years of schooling, on average, students attended private school for 
1.75 years (SD = 3.30); among students who ever attended private 
school, they averaged 5.73 years (SD = 3.59).
Next, our simple bivariate analyses of the associations between 
private school enrollment and ninth-grade outcomes, presented 
in Model 1 of Table 4, demonstrate that without adjusting for 
any selection or family background factors, students who ever 
attended a private school performed significantly better in ninth 
grade compared with students who only attended public schools 
on 14 of the 19 outcomes of interest, with absolute effect sizes of 
roughly 15% to 42% of a standard deviation. That is, students 
who ever attended a private school between kindergarten and 
ninth grade performed better academically, were more likely to 
take courses that were more rigorous, were more likely to expect 
to finish high school and attend (and complete) college, exhib-
ited more optimal social-behavioral skills, and were less likely to 
engage in risky behaviors during ninth grade. The only excep-
tions to this general pattern was that adolescents who ever 
attended a private school did not demonstrate fewer internaliz-
ing behavior problems, they were not more (or less) likely to be 
victimized, nor did they exhibit higher self-concepts. Similar 
associations emerged when looking at the number of years stu-
dents experienced private school education (see Model 1 of Table 
5), with effect sizes of 8% to 18% of a standard deviation. In 
total, 24 of the 27 significant main effects of private school edu-
cation had a p value of .01 or lower (and 15 of the 27 were sig-
nificant at p < .001).
Again, these results are not adjusted for the factors that 
account for families’ capacity or choice to enroll their child in a 
private school; as such, they are biased to the extent that unmea-
sured factors tap into selection effects. We present them here as 
the first step in a sequence of analyses intended to illustrate the 
confounding role of various factors as they pertain to students’ 
age 15 outcomes, one of which is enrollment in private school.
Having established the bivariate associations between school 
type and adolescents’ ninth-grade functioning, we next esti-
mated a series of models that iteratively included different blocks 
of covariates that are regularly implicated in students’ school per-
formance and their likelihood of attending a public or private 
school (i.e., confounding or selection factors). Results from these 
adjusted models revealed that after accounting for any number

of potential confounds, students who attended private schools 
did not perform better than their peers who experienced public 
school education on any of the outcomes of interest (see Models 
2, 3, and 4 of Tables 4 and 5). In fact, after accounting for fami-
lies’ income-to-needs ratio alone, only 1 of the 13 (when looking 
at the years of private school education) and 3 of the 14 (when 
looking at whether children ever enrolled in a private school) 
findings that were significantly different at a bivariate level 
remained significantly different. Put another way, the apparent 
“advantages” of private school education discussed previously in 
the simple bivariate comparisons that were not adjusted for con-
founds were almost entirely due to the socioeconomic advan-
tages that selected families into these types of schools and were 
not attributed to private school education itself. And when we 
included middle childhood and adolescent covariates, we found 
no differences in our general conclusions (see Model 5 of Tables 
4 and 5).
Finally, when examining whether private schools are superior 
for lower income students and students in rural versus urban 
communities, we found that none of the 152 coefficients was 
statistically significant (see Table 6). When we entered interac-
tion terms into the full sample, we found that only 1 of the 76 
interactions was statistically significant, and therefore, it was not 
interpreted. That is, there was no evidence of differential “effects” 
of private school enrollment across different locations or the 
income distribution.
Robustness Check
T o ensure that our reported findings were robust, we estimated a 
series of supplemental models. First, as a means of addressing 
potential confounds, we estimated propensity score matching 
models (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983). It is important to note 
that these matching models are designed to be used with dichot-
omous predictors. Thus, as part of this algorithm, we matched 
children who never and ever attended private school and used 
the nearest neighbor method (with four matches) with a caliper 
of .01, ensuring a sufficient overlap between the two conditions 
on their propensity scores. Across the 50 imputed data sets, we 
successfully matched roughly 70% of the 1,097 students.
We assessed the quality of the matches in two ways. We first 
checked that the standardized mean difference (SMD) between 
groups for all of the covariates were less than 10% of a standard 
deviation, a benchmark used in the literature to indicate negli-
gible differences (Austin, 2011). We also regressed each of the 
covariates, individually, on the indicator variable that distin-
guished children by school sector within the matched samples. 
Before matching, the average SMD in covariates between stu-
dents who ever and never attended private school was a little over 
25% of a standard deviation, suggesting that children who 
attended private school were qualitatively different from public 
school attendees. However, after matching, the average SMD 
was approximately 3% of a standard deviation, suggesting that 
balance was achieved (see Appendix Table A1). As noted previ-
ously, propensity score matching is designed to be used with 
dichotomous predictors, meaning that this method could not be 
applied for our continuous predictor for years of private school 
enrollment. However, within the matched samples of ever and 
never attendees, we found that the SMD between the covariates 
and years of enrollment was also considerably smaller. When 
regressing the years of private school enrollment on the covari-
ates, we found that the average SMD before matching was 10% 
of a standard deviation; after matching, the average SMD was 
only 3% of a standard deviation. Additionally, before matching, 
over 80% of the covariates were significantly different as a  
function of private school enrollment; after matching, there  
were no longer any significant group differences (see Appendix 
Table A1).
Having successfully achieved balance, we ran a second set of 
regression models within these matched samples. T o guard 
against any remaining bias, our analyses within the matched 
samples also controlled for all of the early childhood covariates 
listed in Table 1, which is recognized as doubly robust estimation 
(for more information on this methodology, see Funk et al., 
2011). Results from these analyses within the matched samples 
confirmed our general conclusions discussed previously (see 
Model 6 of Tables 4 and 5): Among children who were equally 
likely to experience a public or private school education, there 
was no benefit through age 15 of enrollment in a private school.
Finally, because not all children had school records available 
for each wave of data collection, we estimated additional models 
that included an analytic weight that contained the number of 
years of data for which children had school type data. In doing 
so, children who had more data points received greater weight 
than children who had fewer data points. When weighted in this 
manner, we found that overall, students attended 1.71 years  
(SD = 3.23) of private school (vs. 1.75 years in our primary spec-
ification), and among students who ever attended a private 
school, they attended a private school for 5.52 years (SD = 3.57 
vs. 5.73 in our primary specification). Despite this minor fluc-
tuation in the mean years of private school enrollment, results 
from these weighted regressions analyses examining the benefits 
of such enrollment (net of child, family, and neighborhood 
covariates) were also the same as those discussed earlier (see 
Model 7 of Tables 4 and 5).
Discussion
Using a unique longitudinal study of children from 10 locations 
across the United States, the present study examined the extent 
to which enrollment in private schools, adjusted for a wide range 
of family background, child, and schooling factors, was related 
to academic, social, psychological, and attainment outcomes at 
age 15. In unadjusted models, children with a history of enroll-
ment in private schools performed notably better on nearly all 
outcomes assessed in adolescence. However, by simply control-
ling for variation in family income, the majority of these differ-
ences in outcomes were eliminated. In follow-up analyses 
examining whether private schooling might differentially benefit 
children across the income distribution and children across dif-
ferent communities, we found no evidence of heterogeneity.
Importantly, the present study examined not only achieve-
ment, which has been the sole focus of all evaluations of private 
schooling reported to date, but also students’ social adjustment, 
attitudes and motivation, and even risky behavior, all of which 
one assumes might be associated with private school education","of potential confounds, students who attended private schools

given studies demonstrating schooling effects on such factors 
(Pianta et al., 2008; Vandell et al., 2016). In short, despite the 
frequent and pronounced arguments in favor of the use of 
vouchers or other mechanisms to support enrollment in private 
schools as a solution for vulnerable children and families attend-
ing local or neighborhood schools (e.g., Dynarski, 2016; 
Lubienski & Lubienski, 2013; Shakeel, Anderson, & Wolf, 
2017), the present study found no evidence that private schools, 
net of family background (particularly income), are more effec-
tive for promoting student success.
As was noted earlier, the argument for policies and financial 
supports that enable parents to choose private schools as an alter-
native educational opportunity rests in part on assumptions that 
private schools provide a superior and more effective educational 
experience (Dynarski, 2016; Feigenberg, Rivkin, & Yan, 2017; 
Flanders & DeAngelis, 2017; Levchenko & Haidoura, 2016)

and create a market for school choice (Lubienski & Lubienski, 
2013). In prior analysis using the present SECCYD sample, 
observations in first, third, and fifth grades across public and 
private school classrooms detected virtually no differences in 
qualities of instruction, teacher-student interaction, or delivery 
of content, even without adjusting for the students’ family 
income levels (O’Brien & Pianta, 2010). Of note was the very 
wide variation in the nature and quality of private school class-
rooms, which in part might account for the lack of observed 
differences in classroom environments and the age 15 student 
outcomes reported in this paper. As was noted by Berends and 
Waddington (in press), the type of private school children attend 
may moderate the extent of potential benefits, and as with pub-
lic schools, heterogeneity of school and classroom environments 
could be an asset in the sense of reflecting alignment with the 
needs of various students or groups, but it may also reflect a lack 
of an organized and programmatic approach to curriculum, 
teacher development, or school organization and structure 
(DeAngelis & Burke, 2017; Mills & Wolf, 2017).
Although recent studies separating enrollment from length of 
attendance suggest that the longer lower income students remain 
enrolled in a private school (at least up to four years), the higher 
the likelihood of accruing substantial benefits, the present report 
finds that length of enrollment was not associated with student 
outcomes once family income was taken into consideration, 
consistent with other nonexperimental work (Lubienski & 
Lubienski, 2013). For the one-third of the sample enrolled at 
any time in private school, on average, these students attended 
private schools for five to six years, which is longer than the most 
recent follow-up evaluations of voucher programs (Berends & 
Waddington, in press; Mills & Wolf, 2017). Thus, even for stu-
dents who remained in private school for almost half of their 
K–12 experience, there was no discernable association with any 
of the wide range of outcomes we assessed at age 15.
Despite these contributions to the literature, we readily 
acknowledge a number of limitations of the present investiga-
tion. Notably, this is not an experimental study in which stu-
dents enrolled in public or private school at random, thus 
eliminating family background, parenting, or related factors as 
explanations for any benefits detected for private (or public) 
school enrollment. Rather, the analytic models adjusted for a 
host of family, student, and contextual variables that hypotheti-
cally account for selection into private schooling or as explana-
tions for any detected differences. We should note that this list of 
covariates is among the most extensive and comprehensive that 
has been applied to the question of school effects. And once fam-
ily income was accounted for, the large differences in student 
outcomes that apparently favored private school enrollment 
were erased, so in fact, it is not at all clear that the operative 
selection mechanism is other than what is carried by income. We 
also estimated propensity score models, which supported our 
general conclusions when controlling for an extensive set of 
covariates. Ultimately, although correlation does not imply cau-
sation, for a causal impact, a correlation is necessary.
Furthermore, compared to many of the contemporary evalu-
ations of voucher programs (Abdulkadiroglu et al., 2015; Figlio 
& Karbowmic, 2016; Flanders & DeAngelis, 2017; Mills & 
Wolf, 2017), the sample size in the present study is not as large. 
Although our sample had adequate power to detect main effect 
sizes of .10 (for our continuous specification) and .20 (for our 
binary specification) and greater, our analyses of heterogeneity 
were more limited. Thus, those findings should be interpreted 
with caution. And because the NICHD SECCYD sample was 
recruited from 10 sites across the country, reflecting literally 
hundreds of schools (public and private) and school systems, 
there is likely to be heterogeneity in the actual educational pro-
grams. Thus, in the future, closer attention must be paid to het-
erogeneity within the private school sector, which was beyond 
the data we had available.
It is also important to acknowledge that three of our measures 
were based on parental report of youth outcomes and might be 
less valid than direct student assessments because of the central 
role parents play in school choice. Although this is certainly a 
limitation, the parent reports of behavior problems parallel 
youths’ own report of their risky behavior. Relatedly, because the 
standards for assigning grades differ by school district, and per-
haps by schools within a district, the interpretation of the asso-
ciations discussed previously with regards to school grades 
requires caution. Nonetheless, the associations between private 
school enrollment (or lack thereof) and students’ grade point 
average in ninth grade parallel the associations with the direct 
assessments of students’ working memory and their cognitive, 
literacy, and math skills, which lends confidence to our general 
conclusions. Finally, future studies should also consider the tim-
ing of private school enrollment as it may be that private school 
enrollment takes on different meaning during the early (e.g., 
kindergarten and first grade) versus later years (e.g., seventh and 
eighth grades). Unfortunately, this was beyond the scope of the 
data we had available because few students transitioned from a 
public to a private school in the later years.
In sum, we find no evidence for policies that would support 
widespread enrollment in private schools, as a group, as a solu-
tion for achievement gaps associated with income or race. In 
most discussions of such gaps and educational opportunities, it 
is assumed that poor children attend poor quality schools and 
that their families, given resources and flexibility, could choose 
among the existing supply of private schools to select and then 
enroll their children in a school that is more effective and a better 
match for their student’s needs. It is not at all clear that this logic 
holds in the real world of a limited supply of effective schools 
(both private and public) and the indication that once one 
accounts for family background, the existing supply of heteroge-
neous private schools (from which parents select) does not result 
in a superior education (even for higher income students). Given 
that there is some evidence from the experimental literature that 
voucher programs may produce a slight benefit for the achieve-
ment of poor children to the extent they enroll steadily, it appears 
most important to better understand the mechanisms in schools 
of any type and in families that support student success and 
strengthen those resources accordingly.
NOTE
This study was directed by a steering committee and supported 
by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 
(NICHD) through a cooperative agreement (U10), which calls for","and create a market for school choice. In prior analysis using the present SECCYD sample, observations in first, third, and fifth grades across public and private school classrooms detected virtually no differences in qualities of instruction, teacher-student interaction, or delivery of content, even without adjusting for the students’ family income levels. Of note was the very wide variation in the nature and quality of private school classrooms, which in part might account for the lack of observed differences in classroom environments and the age 15 student outcomes reported in this paper. As was noted by Berends and Waddington (in press), the type of private school children attend may moderate the extent of potential benefits, and as with public schools, heterogeneity of school and classroom environments could be an asset in the sense of reflecting alignment with the needs of various students or groups, but it may also reflect a lack of an organized and programmatic approach to curriculum, teacher development, or school organization and structure.
