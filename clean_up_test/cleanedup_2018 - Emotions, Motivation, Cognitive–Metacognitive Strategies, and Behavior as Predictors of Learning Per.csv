Abstract
Several studies have focused on identifying the significant behavioral predictors of
learning performances in web-based courses by examining the log data variables
of learning management systems, including time spent on lectures, the number of
assignments submitted, and so forth. However, such studies fail to quantify the
impact of emotional, motivational, behavioral, and cognitive–metacognitive factors
simultaneously. This research was an attempt to understand the relations between
students’ motivation, cognitive–metacognitive strategies, behavior, and learning per-
formance in the context of blended courses in higher education. Then, relevant
predictors are used to obtain a model to classify the students’ performance and
to identify those who are at risk of failing the course. The authors conducted an

Introduction
Eﬃciency levels in higher education have been criticized for their graduation and
abandonment rates. The Internet has become an important tool to increase the
number of enrolled students in higher education. Thus, online and blended
learning are two solutions to the issues of graduation and abandonment rates.
Approximately 504,000 Mexican students pursue a bachelor’s degree by means
of online or blended programs (Secretarı ´a de Educacio ´nP u ´blica, 2015).
However, only 42% of students conclude their career on time (Asociacio ´n
Nacional de Universidades e Instituciones de Educacio ´n Superior, 2015).
Students fail or drop out of the courses. This delays their graduation or, in
the worst-case scenario, causes them to abandon their studies.
Most universities around the world oﬀer online courses and careers. Learning
management systems (LMS) share learning resources through a system to moni-
tor student learning progress (You, 2015). Several empirical studies have exam-
ined LMS log data variables (in the context of distance learning), including time
spent on lectures, the number of assignments submitted, and so forth. However,
the studies fail to quantify the impact of emotional, motivational, and cognitive–
metacognitive factors at the same time.
Research has recognized the importance of emotions in educational settings.
Several studies have focused on emotions’ relationships to learning achieve-
ments. According to Pekrun (2006) and Pekrun, Frenzel, Goetz, and Perry
(2007), emotions related to learning activities and outcomes can impact learning
achievements. Based on the control-value theory, Pekrun (2006) proposed a
theoretical framework to describe the eﬀects of these emotions on cognitive
resource, motivation, self-regulation, strategy, and achievements. Motivation
plays an important role in learning achievements. It is also a variable inﬂuenced
by the educational context, subject area, and task (Linnenbrink-Garcia, Patall,
& Pekrun, 2016). Motivation can deactivate negative emotions. On the con-
trary, negative emotions, including test anxiety, can prevent failure by
increasing intrinsic motivation and the eﬀort. The relationship between

Blended Learning on LMS
Blended learning combines online and face-to-face instruction (Rooney, 2003;
Young, 2002). Thus, this method emphasizes the central role of computer-based
technologies. Face-to-face learning environments rely on human–human inter-
action. Distributed learning environments place an emphasis on learner–mater-
ial interactions (Graham, 2005). Learner–material interactions can easily be
tracked by means of LMS. Thus, several distance learning research studies
have focused on these interactions. On the other hand, emotions, motivations,
and cognitive–metacognitive strategies have not been considered.
Most universities around the world have adopted LMS (such as Blackboard
and Moodle) in blended courses to facilitate content distribution and monitor
students’ learning progress (You, 2015). Also, the teacher can create a learning
sequence (Hirumi, 2002). This means that the sequence in which students are
invited to review the course material modules is suggested but not required
(Graham, 2005). Other advantages include the cultivation of students’ self-
discipline (Harding, Kaczynski, & Wood, 2005) and the enhancement of
students’ motivation in comparison with traditional face-to-face classes
(Woltering, Herrler, Spitzer, & Spreckelsen, 2009).
Emotions, Motivation, and Regulation
Emotion is a feeling directed toward a real or unreal person, thought, or situ-
ation (Pons, Rosnay, & Cuisinier, 2011). Matthews (1997) stated that emotion
may be conceptualized as a dependent variable (inﬂuenced by processes such as
appraisal) or an independent variable (inﬂuencing information processing and
cognition).
Research shows the importance of emotions in educational settings. Pekrun
(2006) and Pekrun et al. (2007) identiﬁed a set of emotions related to educational
activities and outcomes. These emotions (or achievement emotions) are the

three-dimensional taxonomy (Pekrun, Goetz, Titz, & Perry, 2002): (a) valence
(positive or negative), (b) object focus (activity or outcome), and (c) level of
activation implied (activating or deactivating). According to the control-value
theory, achievement emotions are instigated by the appraisal of both control and
value. For example, a student will enjoy a topic if they are interested in linear
regression and feel capable of handling the work. However, the student will be
frustrated if the valued topic has obstacles without a suﬃcient control.
Activating positive emotions (e.g., task enjoyment) preserves cognitive
resources and promotes the interest and intrinsic motivation. Conversely, deac-
tivating positive emotions (e.g., relaxation) reduces task attention and leads to
superﬁcial information processing. Activating negative emotions (e.g., test
anxiety) reduces cognitive resources available for task purpose and intrinsic
motivation. On the other hand, they can produce a strong motivation.
Deactivating negative emotions reduces cognitive resources and both extrinsic
and intrinsic motivation (Pekrun & Stephens, 2010). This complex relationship
between positive and negative emotions may explain the low correlation between
test anxiety and academic achievement (Hembree, 1988; Ma, 1999). It allows us
to speculate about the circular causal relationship between emotion and cogni-
tion (Kim, Park, & Cozart, 2014; Pekrun, 2006; Pons et al., 2011).
Traditional approaches to the analysis of online learning have been con-
ducted for the purpose of explaining emotional ambivalence (Baker, D’Mello,
Rodrigo, & Graesser, 2010; S. D’Mello, Lehman, Pekrun, & Graesser, 2014).
For example, frustration was found to be less associated with poor learning.
Also, confusion can be beneﬁcial to learning if appropriately regulated and
resolved. When monitoring emotions in diﬀerent computer-based environments,
several studies found that poor learning-related negative emotions (i.e., frustra-
tion, boredom, and confusion) less frequently impact performance (Baker et al.,
2010; Craig, Graesser, Sullins, & Gholson, 2004; S. K. D’Mello, Craig,
Witherspoon, McDaniel, & Graesser, 2008). Students in cognitive disequilib-
rium (i.e., incongruity, dissonance, and internal conﬂict) can create opportu-
nities for the deep learning of diﬃcult content (S. D’Mello et al., 2014).
However, if they fail to restore equilibrium, this state triggers frustration and
eventual boredom (S. D’Mello & Graesser, 2012; S. D’Mello et al., 2014;
Lehman, D’Mello, & Graesser, 2012).
Motivation is a teleological process whereby goal-directed activity is insti-
gated and sustained (Schunk, Pintrich, & Meece, 2008). Academic motivation is
determined by both social factors and learners’ cognition (Anderman &
Dawson, 2011). Cognitive emotion theories (e.g., control-value theory) state
that emotions are related to motivation, learning strategies, cognitive strategies,
self-regulation, and academic achievement (Pekrun et al., 2002). In addition,
emotions are closely and reciprocally linked to motivational antecedents and
their emotional eﬀects (Pekrun, 2006).

oretical models that integrate emotions and motivation. Linnenbrink’s (2007)
model depicts a relation between motivation and engagement mediated by emo-
tions. It supports the hypothesis that a reduction in unpleasant emotions for
motivated students may help to explain higher levels of learning. The model
proposed by Pekrun et al. (2006) suggested that mastery goals are positively
related to hope. It also noted that pride was negatively related to boredom and
anger. While performance-approach goals were positive predictors of pride, per-
formance-avoidance goals were positive predictors of anxiety, hopelessness, and
shame. The theoretical relations of this model were extended to include academic
performance. Empirical evidence shows that performance-approach goals were
positive predictors of performance, and performance-avoidance goals were nega-
tive predictors of performance (Pekrun, Elliot, & Maier, 2009).
Several online and face-to-face empirical studies examined emotions, motiv-
ation, and academic outcomes. For example, Kim et al. (2014) found that
motivation and emotions explain approximately 37% of the variance of stu-
dents’ ﬁnal score. Similarly, Elias, Mustaf, Roslan, and Noah (2011); Stegers-
Jager, Cohen-Schotanus, and Themmen (2012); Mega, Ronconi, and De Beni
(2014); and Kim, Park, Cozart, and Lee (2015) found that motivational variables
explain approximately 25% of students’ performances. Gonza ´lez, Ferna´ndez,
and Paoloni (2017) found that hope and anxiety are mediators between motiv-
ation and learning performance. Hope was found to be a positive predictor of
the latter.
The inﬂuence of metacognitive self-regulation on performance has been stu-
died in both online and face-to-face courses. Kim et al. (2015) detailed a signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerence in emotion, motivation, and metacognitive self-regulation
between students with low and high performance. Kramarski and Gutman
(2006) and Azevedo, Moos, Greene, Winters, and Cromley (2008) found that
metacognitive self-regulation is closely related to students’ achievements. On the
other hand, Lynch (2010); Al-Harthy, Was, and Isaacson (2010); and Cho and

relation, and noncorrelation, respectively) between organization, metacognitive

Data Mining to Forecast Learning Performance
Educational data mining is an interdisciplinary research area dealing with the
development of method to explore data originating in an educational context
(Pen˜ a-Ayala, 2014; Romero & Ventura, 2010). Educational data mining is useful
in student modeling, particularly in the prediction of performance. The forecast
can be carried out by a regression data mining task (numerical/continuous
variable) or classiﬁcation task (discrete/categorical variable; Romero &
Ventura, 2010).

"2018 - Emotions, Motivation, Cognitive–Metacognitive Strategies, and Behavior as Predictors of Learning Per.pdf","Data mining techniques have advantages over statistical techniques, including
linear and logistic regression (LR). Neural networks (NNs) and decision trees
(DTs), unlike statistical techniques, address data sets with a mixture of numerical
and discrete attributes. The data to be analyzed with statistical techniques must
satisfy several assumptions, including normality, nonmulticollinearity, linearity,
and homoscedasticity. Some of these assumptions are often violated, and the ﬁt of
the model is decreased or adjusted. On the other hand, data mining techniques are
less susceptible to the eﬀect of violations. Moreover, most data mining techniques
deal with missing values or are used to replace it (e.g., expectation maximization)
and enhance regression models (Horton & Kleinman, 2007).
There has been an increasing interest in data mining in online learning. The
subject has been considered in several articles, most of which deal with the
construction of models based on behavioral indicators extracted from LMS
logs to predict students’ performance. Cerezo, Sa ´nchez-Santilla´n, Paule-Ruiz,
and Nu´n˜ ez (2016) found that three out of six variables are strongly related to
students’ ﬁnal marks: (a) time spent on practical tasks, (b) words posted in
forums, and (c) delays in the completion of tasks. Similarly, You (2016) modeled
self-regulated behavior using total viewing time, number of sessions, and
number of late submissions as behavioral indicators. You (2016) found that
the regression model explained 58% of the variance in the overall score for
the course. The models for predicting students’ success or failure in a course
are based on data extracted from online forums (Romero, Lo ´pez, Luna, &
Ventura, 2013), activities (i.e., quiz views, assignment views, etc.; Lara,
Lizcano, Martı´nez, Pazos, and Riera, 2014), and the historical grades of activ-
ities (Burgos et al., 2018).
In the context of blended courses, Zacharis (2015) used 29 variables extracted
from LMS and found that four were good predictors: (a) the number of mes-
sages read and posted, (b) content creation, (c) the number of quizzes viewed,
and (d) the number of ﬁles viewed. The predictors explained 50% of the variance
in the course grade. The binary classiﬁcation model (base on those predictors)
correctly classiﬁed 81.3% of students as having failed or not failedthe course. On
the other hand, other factors have not been considered in these models, includ-
ing emotion, motivation, cognitive–metacognitive strategies, and behavior.
Traver, Volchok, Bidjerano, and Shea (2014) established that demographic,
status, social presence, teaching presence, cognitive presence, and learning pres-
ence variables have not been correlated with dropout from or completion of a
blended course. In face-to-face courses, socioeconomic, social, and family vari-
ables, along with historical grades, are used to build classiﬁcation models. The
model with an overall accuracy of 97% was selected (Marquez-Vera, Morales, &
Soto, 2013).
This research was intended as an attempt to understand the relation between
students’ motivation, cognitive–metacognitive strategies, behavior, and
learning performance in the context of blended courses in higher education.

1. What is the relationship between emotions, motivation, cognitive–metacog-

the best model for classifying student learning performance?
Method
Participants and Research Context
The data sets used in this research were gathered from a blended course in applied
computing in biological sciences. The course enrolled 137 undergraduate univer-
sity students. Included in a chemical biology degree program, it combined online
and face-to-face sessions. The online sessions contained learning materials and
learning activities delivered throughout the semester via the Moodle platform. The
face-to-face sessions were intended for student feedback and deep explanations of
learning activities. Thus, communication via forums and chats rarely took place.
A weekly online session was scheduled. Thus, the delivery of learning activ-
ities was provided the same week through Moodle. The students received feed-
back for all uploaded learning activities. The interactions between the students
and Moodle were recorded in a log ﬁle. It provided information about the name,
the time of each online session, the date of delivery of an activity, and the
interaction with learning materials. The learning materials were designed to
comply with the shareable content object reference model (SCORM) standard
(Advanced Distributed Learning, 2004). Therefore, the completion of a given
material and the number of topics reviewed could be tracked by Moodle. The
learning materials or SCORM objects were organized in a hierarchical structure
of topics and subtopics. Students were required to browse all topics and sub-
topics to consider a given learning material as reviewed.
Students needed to log into Moodle each time to review current session or
previous session learning materials. They were not permitted to download learn-
ing materials or browse oﬄine. The course contained three oﬄine examinations,
learning activities, and an end-term project. These were considered when com-
puting each student’s overall grade. Hence, the overall grade represented a meas-
ure of learning performance.
Instruments
Students’ emotions and behaviors were assessed using adaptation of the question-
naire (Skinner, Furrer, Marchand, & Kindermann, 2008). It measured student
engagement and disaﬀection in school (SEDS; Wellborn, 1991). It was

"2018 - Emotions, Motivation, Cognitive–Metacognitive Strategies, and Behavior as Predictors of Learning Per.pdf","administered at the end of the second face-to-face session and after the midterm
and end-term examinations. Twelve items referring to negative emotions (i.e.,
boredom, anxiety, frustration, etc.) measured emotional disaﬀection. Similarly,
ﬁve items relating to positive emotions (or behavioral engagement) measured emo-
tional engagement, and positive behaviors (i.e., attention, eﬀort, etc.) were mea-
sured by ﬁve items. Finally, the behavioral disaﬀection was measured by ﬁve items.
Students’ answers were based on a 5-point Likert scale of agreement where 1
meant strongly agreeand 5 meant strongly disagree. The emotional disaﬀection
questions involved negative emotions. Therefore, low emotional disaﬀection
values meant that they experienced negative emotions. For example, a 1-point
answer to the question ‘‘when we work on something in class, I feel bored’’
meant that a student experienced boredom. The reliability of scores on these
subscales ranged from .871 to .96. The results of the three instruments admin-
istered throughout the semester computed the average of the four subscales.
The motivated strategies for learning questionnaire (MSLQ) assessed motiv-
ation (i.e., self-eﬃcacy, test anxiety, etc.) and cognitive–metacognitive strategies
(i.e., organization, metacognitive self-regulation, etc.; Pintrich, 1991; Pintrich &
de Groot, 1990). The questions in this survey were answered using a Likert scale
ranging from 1 not at all true of meto 7 very true of me. The instrument was
administered midsemester. The reliability of scores on self-eﬃcacy, test anxiety,
metacognitive self-regulation, and organization ranged from .739 to .896.
Finally, Moodle’s log ﬁle computed the number of delivered learning activ-
ities, the number of learning materials reviewed, time spent interacting with
Moodle, the number of partially viewed learning materials, and the number of
missed learning activities.
Data Gathering and Data Analysis
The data used in the current study were collected from the second semester of
2016 scholastic year. At the end of the semester, the logs of students’ interactions
with Moodle, results of SEDS and MSLQ, and overall grade of each student
were used to build a data mining view with 19 variables, including 3 from
Moodle, 4 from SEDS, 11 from MSLQ, and the overall grade. The data analysis
process is illustrated in Figure 1.
First, a correlation analysis was conducted to select the variables that corre-
lated highly with the overall grade of each student. Then, hierarchical regression
analysis was performed. This analysis had two goals: (a) to explain the rela-
tionship between emotions, motivation, cognitive–metacognitive strategies,
behavior, and learning performance in blended learning and (b) to identify sig-
niﬁcant predictors (see Figure 1). Thus, from a data mining point of view, the
hierarchical regression analysis acted as a feature selection task to improve the
classiﬁcation performance (Fayyad, Piatetsky-Shapiro, & Smyth, 1996). Finally,
several classiﬁcation models were built based on the full (F) data mining view (19

was considered as failing the course.
Comparing multiple classiﬁers over multiple data sets is a common task to
evaluate the general performance of data mining techniques. Two-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) is the suitable statistical test for this situation.
Unfortunately, due to the nature of the learning algorithms and data sets, the
normality and homoscedasticity assumptions are often violated (Dem ˇ sar, 2006).
This is true in this case. Thus, a nonparametric test is typically more convenient.
The accuracy of the classiﬁcation of these models was compared by the Scheirer–
Ray–Hare test (Scheirer, Ray, & Hare, 1976). Table 1 shows these models. They
were named based on the data mining view used and the technique by which it
was built. For instance, RNB was based on the R data mining view and its

the students partially viewed approximately 74% of the total materials available
on the LMS. This means that the students skipped at least one topic of the
learning material packaged as SCORM (Advanced Distributed Learning, 2004).
Pearson correlations, presented in Table 3, show that the overall grade of
each student is negatively correlated with behavioral and emotional disaﬀection,
test anxiety, and missing learning activities. However, the overall grade is posi-
tively correlated with extrinsic goal orientation, intrinsic goal orientation, task
value, self-eﬃcacy, control of learning beliefs, metacognitive self-regulation,
rehearsal, elaboration, organization, and critical thinking. Motivation (i.e.,
extrinsic goal orientation, intrinsic goal orientation, task value, self-eﬃcacy,
test anxiety, and control of learning beliefs) and cognitive–metacognitive stra-
tegies (i.e., metacognitive self-regulation, organization, and critical thinking) are
positively correlated with partially viewed learning materials but negatively cor-
related with missing learning activities. The correlations between each motiv-
ational variable (i.e., extrinsic goal orientation, intrinsic goal orientation, task
value, self-eﬃcacy, test anxiety, and control of learning beliefs) and each cogni-
tive–metacognitive strategy (i.e., metacognitive self-regulation, rehearsal, elab-
oration, organization, and critical thinking) are also positive.
The condition index, variance inﬂation factor, and tolerance were checked
among the predictors to determine the existence of multicollinearity issues. This
analysis shows multicollinearity issues between returned and missing learning
activities and fully viewed and partially viewed learning materials. Thus,
returned learning activities and learning materials are not included in the hier-
archical regression analysis.
Hierarchical Regression Analyses
To perform the correlation analysis, those variables with a signiﬁcant correlation
with the student’s overall grade were selected (see Table 3). First, the missing
learning activities variable was entered in Step 1. Extrinsic goal orientation,
intrinsic goal orientation, task value, self-eﬃcacy, test anxiety, and control of
learning beliefs were entered in Step 2. Emotional disaﬀection was added in Step
3. Metacognitive self-regulation, rehearsal, elaboration, organization, and crit-
ical thinking were added in Step 4. Finally, behavioral disaﬀection was entered
in Step 5.
The analysis strategy was based on the following considerations. First, the
learning activities represent a percentage of the overall grade of each student.
Second, emotions are often considered a result of motivational factors despite
their bidirectional inﬂuence (Kim et al., 2014; Marchand & Gutierrez, 2012;
Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun et al., 2002). Third, metacognitive self-regulation inﬂu-

Data Mining Models
For practical purposes, forecasting students’ risk of failing the course is more
useful than predicting overall scores. Working under this assumption, the accur-
acy of several classiﬁcation models is evaluated. The construction of models is
based on F (19-variable) and R (6-variable) data mining views. As presented, six
variables were selected by hierarchical regression analysis. To evaluate each
model, a 10-fold cross-validation (repeated 10 times) was performed. The
WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) data mining software was used to build the models.
Those students with an overall grade of less than six (those who failed the
course) were categorized as FA. Otherwise, students were categorized as AP.
The classiﬁcation accuracy data were not normal. Therefore, the Scheirer–Ray–
Hare test was used in place of two-way ANOVA (Scheirer et al., 1976). Table 5
presents the descriptive statistics of the classiﬁcation accuracy of the models.

Relationship Between Emotions, Motivation, Cognitive–Metacognitive
Strategies, Behavior, and Learning Performance
In this report, the authors provided a comprehensive identiﬁcation of the rela-
tionship between emotions, motivation, behavior, and cognitive–metacognitive
strategies, as well as their eﬀects on students’ performance. Negative emotions
(or emotional disaﬀection) were reported by the participants in this research.
Although emotional ambivalence was reported (Baker et al., 2010; S. D’Mello
et al., 2014), the presented results show that each students’ overall grade was
negatively aﬀected by both negative emotions and test anxiety. Also, positive
emotions (or emotional engagement) were not signiﬁcantly correlated with over-
all grade. Thus, they were not included in the hierarchical regression analysis.

positive ones.
Recent eﬀorts by several researchers in the ﬁeld of online learning have
demonstrated that motivation plays an important role in learning performance.
The results show that self-eﬃcacy (motivational factor) positively aﬀect the
overall grade. On the other hand, extrinsic goal orientation, intrinsic goal orien-
tation, task value, and control of learning beliefs are not signiﬁcant predictors of
learning performance. In this research, emotions were considered a result of
motivational factors despite their bidirectional inﬂuences (Kim et al., 2014;
Marchand & Gutierrez, 2012; Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun et al., 2002). The correlation
analysis shows that motivation (extrinsic goal orientation, intrinsic goal orien-
tation, task value, self-eﬃcacy, test anxiety, and control of learning beliefs) is
signiﬁcant and negatively correlated with emotional disaﬀection. Thus, motiv-
ation may reduce negative emotions. Similarly, motivation may increase the use
of cognitive and metacognitive strategies.
Diﬀerences between students with low and high performances in metacogni-
tive self-regulation have been found in previous studies. Contrary ﬁndings of
other investigations have yielded modest to low correlation or noncorrelation
between metacognitive self-regulation and students’ overall grades. It suggests
complex relationships. The results of the authors show that metacognitive self-
regulation and organization signiﬁcantly correlate with students’ performance
and play an important role in blended learning. These results support the ﬁnd-
ings of previous research studies (Kim et al., 2015).
In this study, Moodle logs were analyzed to extract indicators of students’
behaviors. The variable measure of whether learning activities had been missed
(missing learning activities) was included in the model to explain 19% of the
variation in the overall grade (Zacharis, 2015). Other studies revealed that several
LMS indicators were highly correlated with learning performance (Cerezo et al.,
2016; Lara et al., 2014; Romero et al., 2013; You, 2016; Zacharis, 2015). Yet, the
variables of partially viewed learning materials and time spent were excluded from
the model at the ﬁrst step of the hierarchical regression analysis. Finally, students’
self-reported behaviors (behavioral engagement and behavioral disaﬀection) were
not good predictors of learning performance. In blended learning, these results
suggest that negative emotions, motivation, and cognitive–metacognitive factors
are more important than LMS indicators of students’ behaviors.

and four classiﬁcation techniques. The Scheirer–Ray–Hare test shows a signiﬁ-

using data regarding missed learning activities, along with self-eﬃcacy, test anx-

discriminatively predict students’ performance.
Limitations of the Present Study
The correlation analysis shows that relationships between motivation and cog-
nitive–metacognitive strategies and motivation and missing learning activities
were signiﬁcant. However, the causation cannot be established by this analysis.
Thus, structural equation modeling is appropriate. The hierarchical regression
analysis identiﬁes direct relations from the predictors to overall grade. To avoid

that play a mediator role may be neglected.
Conclusion and Future Work
In this article, empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that emotions, motiv-
ation, cognitive–metacognitive strategies, and missed learning activities (as an
indicator of student behavior) predict students’ performance. Self-reported
behaviors (time spent on LMS and partially viewed learning materials) are
unrelated to students’ overall grades. Thus, empirical evidence suggests that
emotions, motivation, and cognitive–metacognitive strategies in blended learn-
ing are closely correlated with student performance.
These ﬁndings, as well as the need to identify students at risk of failing
the course, encouraged the building of a data mining model to correctly clas-
sify 96% of the students. This model paves the way for enhanced LMS
use in blended learning by monitoring emotions, motivation, and cognitive–
metacognitive strategies to forecast the learning performance.
The present research shows the importance of emotion, motivation, and cog-
nitive–metacognitive strategies in predicting students’ learning performance.
