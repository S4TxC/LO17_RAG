Teachers’ social support and classroom management are related to secondary students’ achievement,
domain-specific interest, and self-concept. However, little is known about whether social support and
classroom management shape secondary students’ general school adjustment beyond these domain-
specific outcomes. To investigate this question, we drew on data from a large longitudinal research
project (N /H110055,607 secondary students,N /H11005227 classes). We applied student and teacher ratings of social
support and classroom management to investigate their perspective-specific validities for predicting
student outcomes. To measure students’ school adjustment, we assessed achievement as a domain-
specific indicator and school satisfaction, truancy, and self-esteem as more general aspects. Multilevel
confirmatory factor analyses showed that both teachers and students distinguished between social support
and classroom management. Teacher and student ratings of classroom management largely converged,
whereas their perceptions of social support were not statistically significantly associated with one
another. In multilevel structural equation modeling, both perspectives uniquely predicted students’ school
adjustment: Student-rated social support was linked to all outcomes at the student level and to school
satisfaction and self-esteem at the class level. Classroom management showed only weak associations
with outcomes at the student level, but at the class level, student-rated classroom management was related
to truancy and teacher-rated classroom management was linked to school satisfaction and student
achievement. These findings highlight the important role of teachers in students’ general school
adjustment and show the benefit of considering different perspectives and levels of analyses.
Educational Impact and Implications Statement
This study investigated associations between teachers’ classroom management and social support with
students’ school adjustment. Results showed that classroom management and social support relate to
student achievement in the teacher’s subject domain, but also to more general outcomes such as overall
school satisfaction, truancy, and self-esteem. Therefore, enhancing teachers’ classroom management and
social support could promote students’ positive development in specific subject domains and beyond.

2018 - Social Support and Classroom Management Are Related to Secondary Students’ General School Adjustment.pdf,"Social support and classroom management are key dimensions
of teachers’ interpersonal behavior because they are associated
with the satisfaction of adolescents’ developmental needs, and thus
with their positive development (Hamre et al., 2013; Kunter &
Voss, 2013; Roeser, Eccles, & Sameroff, 2000; Skinner, Furrer,
Marchand, & Kindermann, 2008 ; Wubbels, Créton, Levy, &
Hooymayers, 1993). In line with this assumption, there is cumu-
lated empirical evidence that teachers’ social support and class-
room management are related to secondary students’ achievement,
interest, and self-concept in different subject domains (den Brok,
Brekelmans, & Wubbels, 2004; Kunter et al., 2013; Scherer,
Nilsen, & Jansen, 2016). However, it remains unclear whether
social support and classroom management are also associated with
more general outcomes that are not restricted to specific subject
domains, such as school satisfaction, truancy, or self-esteem (An-
derman, 2002; Baker, Dilly, Aupperlee, & Patil, 2003; Wentzel,
2003). Furthermore, some methodological challenges have not
received sufficient attention in previous research. First, it is un-
clear to what extent different raters’ perceptions of classroom
management and social support converge and which perspective—
student, teacher, or observer—provides the most valid information
for predicting student outcomes (Wagner et al., 2016). Second,
student ratings yield information on different conceptual levels of
analysis (Lüdtke, Robitzsch, Trautwein, & Kunter, 2009), but this
advantage has rarely been employed in previous research on class-
room management and social support because a large number of
classes are needed to disentangle the effects of student ratings at
the individual and class level.
To address these issues, we used data from a large longitudinal
research project among two cohorts of German secondary students
(Jonkmann, Rose, & Trautwein, 2013). We asked 5,607 students
and their homeroom teachers (N /H11005227 classes) to rate the teach-
er’s social support and classroom management. In Germany, stu-
dents usually spend the entire day with the same group of students.
Each group of students is assigned a homeroom teacher who not
only teaches at least one subject, but also goes on school trips with
the class, counsels students and parents, and bears special respon-
sibility for all class-related issues. Moreover, homeroom teachers
in Germany retain their class for several years. Therefore, home-
room teachers’ interpersonal behavior, in particular, can be as-
sumed to be linked not only to outcomes in their specific subject,
but also to students’ general school adjustment. Our methodolog-
ical approach of combining student and teacher ratings had some
compelling advantages. It enabled us to investigate whether both
teachers and students—at the individual student and at the class
level—perceive classroom management and social support as dis-
tinct dimensions of teachers’ interpersonal behavior. It also pro-
vided insights on the extent to which students’ and teachers’
perceptions of classroom management and social support con-
verge. And most importantly, it enabled us to investigate differ-
ential relations between classroom management, social support
and students’ school adjustment depending on the perspective of
the rater (student vs. teacher perspective) and the level of analysis
(student vs. class level).
Classroom Management and Social Support
Social support and classroom management are widely consid-
ered the two central dimensions of teachers’ interpersonal behavior
(e.g., Hamre et al., 2013; Kunter & Voss, 2013; Wubbels, Créton,
et al., 1993). Scholars agree that social support subsumes a variety
of teacher behaviors (Kunter & Voss, 2013; Tennant et al., 2015),
including, the overall emotional tone in the classroom, the extent
to which teachers take a personal interest, provide encouragement
to students, and show affection, acceptance, and respect (Patrick,
Turner, Meyer, & Midgley, 2003). Supportive teachers also help
students meet content-related challenges and adapt their instruc-
tion to students’ individual learning needs (Strati, Schmidt, &
Maier, 2017).
Classroom management comprises the organizational and group
management methods teachers use to establish and maintain order
and discipline as well as strategies to handle persistent behavior
problems by individual students, such as disruptions, tardiness, or
truancy (Emmer & Stough, 2001). By ensuring that students adapt
their behavior to situational demands, time on task is maximized
(Brophy, 2006). Communicating clear behavioral expectations and
rules, introducing routines, and monitoring student behavior are
particularly effective in this regard (Clunies-Ross, Little, & Kien-
huis, 2008; Evertson & Weinstein, 2011; Mitchell & Bradshaw,
2013).
Considering that social support and classroom management
describe essentially different kinds of teachers’ interpersonal be-
havior, it appears reasonable to assume that both are empirically
distinct constructs and this has been supported in prior research
(Downer, Stuhlman, Schweig, Martinez, & Ruzek, 2014; Fauth,
Decristan, Rieser, Klieme, & Büttner, 2014; Kunter & Baumert,
2006; Wagner, Göllner, Helmke, Trautwein, & Lüdtke, 2013). Yet,
some studies found aspects of teachers’ interpersonal behavior to
be highly correlated (Hamre, Hatfield, Pianta, & Jamil, 2014;
Wallace, Kelcey, & Ruzek, 2016). Therefore, further research is
needed to reveal whether classroom management and social sup-
port can actually be distinguished empirically.
Classroom Management, Social Support, and
Students’ Domain-Specific Outcomes
According to prominent models of instructional quality, aspects
of social support and classroom management are closely associ-
ated with higher achievement, more positive self-related beliefs,
better attitudes, and behavioral outcomes in a given subject domain
(e.g., Ferguson, 2012; Hamre et al., 2013; Kunter & Voss, 2013).
From the perspective of self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci,
2000), the psychological process mediating these positive associ-
ations is students’ basic need satisfaction (Gairns, Whipp, &
Jackson, 2015; Skinner et al., 2008): If teachers prevent disrup-
tions, assure that lessons start punctually (classroom management),
and offer assistance with difficulties (social support), students will
receive more opportunities to obtain content knowledge and com-
plete their academic tasks successfully, giving them a feeling of
competence in the corresponding subject domain (Brophy, 2006;
Niemiec & Ryan, 2009). Furthermore, if teachers react sensitively
to students’ emotional needs and consider their personal interests
(social support), students will feel more connected and respected
as autonomous individuals (Ruzek et al., 2016; Skinner et al.,
2008).

ment, social support, and student achievement, self-related be-
liefs, attitudes, and behavioral engagement in the corresponding

overall achievement in the respective domain was higher in
well-organized classrooms (Blank & Shavit, 2016; Kunter et al.,
2013; Scherer et al., 2016; Wagner et al., 2016). In contrast, social
support appeared to be less important for student achievement in
secondary school (Kunter et al., 2013; Scherer et al., 2016; Wagner
et al., 2016; Yildirim, 2012). From a theoretical perspective, this
finding may appear unexpected. One explanation could be that
teachers report offering more academic support to low-achieving
students (Nurmi et al., 2013). In terms ofself-related beliefs, prior
research has found that students report higher domain-specific
self-efficacy and self-concept when they feel supported by their
subject teacher (den Brok et al., 2004; Rice, Barth, Guadagno,
Smith, & McCallum, 2013; Scherer et al., 2016; Wagner et al.,
2016). The close association appears reasonable considering that
positive regard and encouragement from others as well as individ-
ual assistance in overcoming task-related difficulties could be
particularly important for developing positive self-related beliefs
(Harter, 1999; Lemay & Ashmore, 2006; Usher & Pajares, 2008).
In contrast, the current state of research provides mixed results for
classroom management. Some studies found a positive association,
while others revealed a negative relationship or no link at all (den
Brok et al., 2004; Scherer et al., 2016; Wagner et al., 2016). Even
though the findings do not allow drawing of a clear conclusion yet,
it is possible that classroom management only relates to higher
self-related beliefs under certain conditions. For example, when
students participate in creating rules, they might infer that they are
on a par with adults, while they might feel infantilized, when rules
are forced on them by the teacher alone (Watson & Battistich,
2006). Forstudent attitudes, associations between both classroom
management and social support and intrinsic value, interest, en-
joyment, and satisfaction with class have been found (den Brok et
al., 2004; Dietrich, Dicke, Kracke, & Noack, 2015; Kunter et al.,
2013; Kunter & Baumert, 2006; Kunter, Baumert, & Köller, 2007;
Rice et al., 2013). Similar results have been obtained forbehav-
ioral outcomes, with classes with more social support and class-
room management exhibiting higher behavioral engagement in the
corresponding subject domain (den Brok et al., 2004; Nie & Lau,
2009).
Classroom Management, Social Support, and
Students’ General School Adjustment
In contrast to the extensive body of research on the association
between classroom management, social support, and domain-
specific outcomes, less is known about secondary students’ more
general school adjustment. In the present work, we focused on
school satisfaction, truancy, and self-esteem as a global attitude,
behavior, and self-related belief, respectively, because they are of
great practical relevance: School satisfaction and reduced truancy
are related to higher school engagement and a lower risk of school
dropout (Elmore & Huebner, 2010; Kearney, 2008; Sälzer, Trau-
twein, Lüdtke, & Stamm, 2012). Moreover, schools are increas-
ingly asked to foster students’ self-esteem, which is associated
with a better ability to cope with emotions and greater psycholog-
ical well-being (Lipnevich, Preckel, & Roberts, 2016; Moksnes,
Moljord, Espnes, & Byrne, 2010; Orth, Robins, & Roberts, 2008).
From a theoretical point of view, there are at least two possible
mechanisms linking teachers’ interpersonal behavior to students’
general school adjustment. First, as the empirical findings de-
scribed above showed, social support and classroom management
are associated with positive beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors in the
corresponding subject domain. Bottom-up processes could, then,
produce an accumulation of domain-specific outcomes at a more
global domain-unspecific level (Harter, 1999; Rojas, 2006). A
second, analog mechanism is to view each teacher’s social support
and classroom management as a component of students’ overall
school experience (Baker et al., 2003). Hence, each teacher con-
tributes to students’ perceptions of school as a context that sup-
ports their healthy development by meeting their basic psycholog-
ical needs (Anderman, 2002; Baker et al., 2003; Roeser et al.,
2000). Thereby, it is important to note that one significant teacher-
student relationship can already be associated with secondary
school students’ positive general development, even though they
have many teachers at the same time (Pajares & Urdan, 2008; van
Ryzin, 2010).
There is some initial empirical evidence in support of these
assumptions. In a study byNie and Lau (2009), feeling supported
by one’s English teacher was associated with higher school satis-
faction. Moreover, some studies revealed links between classroom
management, social support, and secondary school students’ gen-
eral behavioral adjustment in school; for instance, they were cor-
related with less truancy and higher school engagement (Havik,
Bru, & Ertesvåg, 2015; Jelas, Azman, Zulnaidi, & Ahmad, 2016).
Our study aimed to extend these findings by investigating the
association between homeroom teachers’ social support and class-
room management and students’ general school adjustment in
terms of self-esteem, school satisfaction, and truancy as well as
achievement in the homeroom teacher’s subjects as a domain-
specific outcome. Beyond that, our study also addressed some
important methodological challenges that have not been suffi-
ciently investigated in prior research.
Methodological Issues in Research on Social Support
and Classroom Management
Three different types of informants have frequently been used to
assess social support and classroom management: students, teach-
ers, and external observers (Turner & Meyer, 2000). Which rater
provides the most valid information for predicting student out-
comes is still a controversial issue (Wagner et al., 2016). None-
theless, most prior studies have relied on only one of these infor-
mants and did not consider how this could impact their findings.
Moreover, the multilevel nature of the data has often been ignored,
particularly in research on social support. As will be outlined
below, this may not only affect statistical inference, but is also
problematic from a conceptual point of view (Lüdtke et al., 2009).
Therefore, in this study we combined student and teacher ratings
and analyses at the individual student level and the class level.
Assessment of Social Support and Classroom
Management: Student and Teacher Perspectives
Student and teacher ratings are each associated with specific
advantages, but also drawbacks. Student ratings are particularly
appealing because students’ individual experiences should be most
relevant for their development (Lüdtke et al., 2009). Teacher
ratings are expedient because teachers’ professional backgrounds

ratings are expedient because teachers’ professional backgrounds"
2018 - Social Support and Classroom Management Are Related to Secondary Students’ General School Adjustment.pdf,"make them experts on classroom processes (Kunter & Baumert,
2006). However, both student and teacher ratings have also been
suspected of being invalid, with student ratings biased by individ-
ual idiosyncrasies and teacher popularity, and teacher ratings bi-
ased by self-serving strategies or ideals (Kopcha & Sullivan, 2007;
Marsh & Roche, 1997 ; Miller, 2012; Stern, 1970; Wubbels,
Brekelmans, & Hooymayers, 1993).
The presumption that student and teacher ratings are largely
shaped by personal interpretations seems to be supported by the
finding that their perceptions often diverge considerably: Studies
administering identical items to students and teachers have found
low-to-moderate correlations for social support, whereas conver-
gence was substantial for classroom management ( Kunter &
Baumert, 2006; Wagner et al., 2016; Wubbels, Brekelmans, et al.,
1993). These studies also showed that student and teacher ratings
of classroom management and social support loaded onto different
factors (Kunter & Baumert, 2006; Wagner et al., 2016). Further-
more, the few studies that considered both student and teacher
perspectives typically found associations between classroom man-
agement, social support, and student outcomes to be stronger when
the same source of information was used (e.g.,Hughes & Kwok,
2007; Kunter & Baumert, 2006; Skinner et al., 2008; Wagner et al.,
2016). This might be attributable to shared method bias, meaning
that the association between predictor and outcome is artificially
inflated, for example, because both are rated by the same person
with a certain rater tendency (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &
Podsakoff, 2003). Or, the lack of convergence and differential
predictive validity may be due to the fact that students and teachers
focus on different aspects when evaluating social support and
classroom management ( Kunter & Baumert, 2006 ). Thereby,
teachers’ perceptions of classroom management might add a par-
ticularly valuable perspective to student ratings because they can
best evaluate whether their teaching objectives have been dis-
turbed or not, whereas they might be less sensitive to students’
need for individual support (Kunter & Voss, 2013).
Multilevel Issues in the Study of Classroom
Management and Social Support
The second issue we raised with regard to the empirical findings
presented above was that the multilevel nature of student ratings
has often been neglected. This point is crucial because the inter-
pretation of results largely depends on the level of analysis (Lüdtke
et al., 2009; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). At the class level,
students’ individual ratings are aggregated to represent their shared
perception of classroom management and social support, and anal-
yses explain differences in outcomes between classrooms. In con-
trast, at the student level, analyses focus on students’ individual
interpretations, that is, the extent to which individual student
perceptions diverge from the class average, to explain different
student outcomes within the same classroom. Most of the studies
discussed above did not appropriately disentangle the two levels or
focused exclusively on the class level (e.g.,Kunter et al., 2013;
Rice et al., 2013). From a theoretical standpoint, it has been argued
that the class level is of particular interest because classroom
management and social support have been conceptualized as a
feature of the classroom (Marsh et al., 2012). Moreover, analyses
at the class level have methodological advantages because they
counterbalance student idiosyncrasies so that associations can
more likely be attributed to between-class differences in classroom
management and social support rather than general rater tenden-
cies (Lüdtke et al., 2009). Hence, it could be argued that results at
the class level are less affected by shared method bias, at least to
some extent (Hoyt, 2000). However, conducting analyses at the
student level can also be worthwhile and it has been argued that
students’ individual ratings can hold valuable information, even
though, they are shaped by students’ idiosyncrasies and reflect
students’ unique interpretations of events (Downer et al., 2014;
Schenke, Ruzek, Lam, Karabenick, & Eccles, 2017; Schweig,
2016). For example, students’ individual perceptions can reveal
whether teachers’ behaviors match each student’s individual needs
(Eccles et al., 1993), as diverging perceptions may actually be
grounded in unequal treatment of different students in response to
their individual characteristics and behaviors (Babad, 2009; Nurmi
& Kiuru, 2015). Thus, students’ individual perceptions might be
particularly relevant for social support because, in contrast to
classroom management, supportive behaviors often address indi-
vidual students rather than the whole class.
Multilevel modeling can be used to predict student outcomes at
the individual and class level simultaneously, and so doing com-
bine the advantages of the individual student and the class per-
spective (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). Before such analyses can be
performed, however, one must investigate the factorial structure at
each level separately to attain valid results (Muthén, 1994). Initial
studies among elementary students indicated that classroom man-
agement and social support represent empirically distinguishable
factors at both levels (Downer et al., 2014; Fauth et al., 2014).
These studies also showed that simultaneous analyses at the stu-
dent and class level are a very informative approach because the
relationships between classroom management, social support, and
school adjustment may largely depend on the level of analysis.
However, the results did not yield a consistent pattern of associ-
ations (Dietrich et al., 2015; Downer et al., 2014; Fauth et al.,
2014). Therefore, more research is needed to clearly underpin or
reject the theoretical assumption that both social support and
classroom management could be associated with student outcomes
at the class level, whereas social support could be particularly
predictive at the student level.
Present Study
In the present study, we drew on longitudinal data from a large
sample of secondary school students and their homeroom teachers
and linked both informants’ perceptions of social support and
classroom management to achievement, school satisfaction, self-
esteem, and truancy. We addressed three central research questions
using multilevel analyses.
First, because very few studies have combined student and
teacher ratings with simultaneous analyses at the student and the
class level (for exceptions, see, e.g.,Downer et al., 2014; Kunter
& Baumert, 2006), we tested whether social support and classroom
management represented distinct factors at both levels and regard-
less of whether student or teacher ratings are applied. This is
particularly important in light of recent work challenging their
distinctness (e.g., Wallace et al., 2016).
Second, we examined the convergence of student and teacher
ratings of social support and classroom management. We pro-
ceeded from the assumption that disagreement between students

1069TEACHER BEHAVIOR, STUDENTS AND SCHOOL ADJUSTMENT","make them experts on classroom processes. However, both student and teacher ratings have also been suspected of being invalid, with student ratings biased by individual idiosyncrasies and teacher popularity, and teacher ratings biased by self-serving strategies or ideals.
The presumption that student and teacher ratings are largely
shaped by personal interpretations seems to be supported by the
finding that their perceptions often diverge considerably: Studies
administering identical items to students and teachers have found
low-to-moderate correlations for social support, whereas conver-
gence was substantial for classroom management. These studies also showed that student and teacher ratings
of classroom management and social support loaded onto different
factors. Further-
more, the few studies that considered both student and teacher
perspectives typically found associations between classroom man-
agement, social support, and student outcomes to be stronger when
the same source of information was used. This might be attributable to shared method bias, meaning
that the association between predictor and outcome is artificially

Present Study
In the present study, we drew on longitudinal data from a large
sample of secondary school students and their homeroom teachers
and linked both informants’ perceptions of social support and
classroom management to achievement, school satisfaction, self-
esteem, and truancy. We addressed three central research questions
using multilevel analyses.
First, because very few studies have combined student and
teacher ratings with simultaneous analyses at the student and the
class level , we tested whether social support and classroom
management represented distinct factors at both levels and regard-
less of whether student or teacher ratings are applied. This is

Second, we examined the convergence of student and teacher
ratings of social support and classroom management. We pro-
ceeded from the assumption that disagreement between students"
2018 - Social Support and Classroom Management Are Related to Secondary Students’ General School Adjustment.pdf,"and teachers is based on the fact that both perceive perspective-
specific aspects of teachers’ interpersonal behavior (Kunter &
Baumert, 2006). Therefore, we expected that student- and teacher-
rated social support and classroom management would represent
distinct factors, resulting in a four-factor solution at the class level,
with moderate to high correlations between student- and teacher-
rated classroom management, but small correlations between
student- and teacher-rated social support.
Our third and main research question concerned the association
between classroom management, social support, and school ad-
justment. Thereby, this study is innovative in three aspects. First,
prior research among secondary students has mostly focused on
domain-specific outcomes. We argued that homeroom teachers’
interpersonal behavior might not only be associated with outcomes
in the subjects they teach, but also with students’ general school
adjustment due to their special function in students’ school lives.
Therefore, we included truancy, school satisfaction, and self-
esteem in addition to achievement to extend our knowledge to
broader outcomes. Furthermore, building upon our second re-
search question, we investigated the perspective-specific validity
of student and teacher ratings in predicting student outcomes.
Finally, we disentangled the student and the class level which
enabled us to discover potentially different patterns depending on
the level of analysis. From a theoretical point of view (e.g.,
self-determination theory;Ryan & Deci, 2000), generally positive
associations between classroom management, social support, and
student development are plausible because both are linked to
students’ basic need satisfaction and therefore help to create a
positive school context (Baker et al., 2003; Skinner et al., 2008). In
line with this, prior research has shown that both are linked to
student attitudes and behaviors in specific subject domains (e.g.,
den Brok et al., 2004) so that we, analogously, expected positive
associations with school satisfaction and truancy. In contrast,
particularly social support has been empirically linked to students’
self-related beliefs in specific subject domains, whereas only class-
room management has been related to achievement (e.g.,Wagner
et al., 2016).Therefore, we assumed that social support would be
related to self-esteem and that classroom management would be
linked to achievement. Thereby, we expected differential relations
depending on the level of analysis and whether the student or
teacher perspective was being considered. More precisely, we
assumed that social support would be predictive at both the student
and the class level, whereas classroom management would be
primarily predictive at the class level. After all, management
strategies usually address the classroom as a whole, whereas
teachers might provide varying levels of social support to individ-
ual students (Nurmi & Kiuru, 2015). Moreover, we hypothesized
that the student perspective, especially students’ ratings of social
support, would be more predictive of student development than the
teacher perspective (Kunter & Voss, 2013; Lüdtke et al., 2009).
Method
Procedure
The present study draws on data from two cohorts and two
measurement points: The first measurement point took place in the
fall of the 2008–2009 school year when the students were in fifth
and eighth grade; the second measurement point took place ap-
proximately 1 year later when students were in sixth and ninth
grade. The first measurement point was used to assess students’
baseline levels of school satisfaction, truancy, self-esteem, and
German and mathematics achievement. The second measurement
point represented the prime focus of our study because teachers
had spent over a year with their class by this time, allowing
potential effects to have unfolded. Both students and teachers rated
classroom management and social support. In addition, students’
school satisfaction, truancy, self-esteem, and achievement were
assessed again. The achievement tests were obligatory, whereas
filling out the questionnaires was voluntary and parents were asked
for consent.
Sample
The present study was part of a larger longitudinal research
project carried out in two German federal states (Baden-
Württemberg and Saxony) to investigate student development in
secondary school, specifically in the vocational track (Jonkmann et
al., 2013). In Germany, students are allocated to either the voca-
tional track or the academic track at the end of primary school
based on prior achievement ( Maaz, Trautwein, Lüdtke, &
Baumert, 2008). In contrast to the academic track, students in the
vocational track cannot proceed to higher education. The structure
of the vocational track depends on the federal state: Either there is
only one comprehensive school (Saxony) or students are further
divided into lower track schools and intermediate track schools
(Baden-Württemberg).
The study was conducted in 227 classrooms in 106 German
schools: 31 schools included one participating classroom, 55
schools included two participating classrooms, and 20 schools
included three or more participating classrooms. Note that in our
sample, each classroom consisted of a fixed group of students.
Hence, classroom composition remained constant throughout the
school day. At the second (first) measurement point, 93% (95%) of
the eligible students completed the achievement tests and 79%
(82%) filled in the questionnaires. At the first measurement point,
N /H110055,030 students participated (M /H1100522.26 students per class-
room, SD /H110055.01). At thesecond measurement point,N /H110054,930
students participated (M /H1100521.72 students per classroom,SD /H110055.15).
To use all available information, we included data from all students
who had participated at either the first (n /H11005677), the second
(n /H11005577), or both measurement points (n /H110054,353), so that our final
sample includedN /H110055,607 students (Enders, 2010). We found no
statistically significant differences between students who participated
at the first, second, or both measurement points in terms of grade level
or socioeconomic status, but boys, students with a migration back-
ground and students from lower track schools were slightly overrep-
resented in the group of students who participated only once (see
Table S1 in the online supplemental materials for more detailed
results).
We assessed n /H110053,123 fifth-grade students (M
age /H1100511.14,
SD /H110050.59; 131 classes) and n /H110052,484 eighth-grade students
(Mage /H1100514.26, SD /H110050.67; 96 classes). Of these students, 54%
were male. 28% had a migration background, meaning that at least
one parent or the students themselves were not born in Germany.
Students’ socioeconomic status was indicated by the highest value
of the international socioeconomicindex of occupational status in
the family (Ganzeboom, de Graaf, & Treiman, 1992), and was

To use all available information, we included data from all students
who had participated at either the first (n /H11005677), the second

or socioeconomic status, but boys, students with a migration back-
ground and students from lower track schools were slightly overrep-
resented in the group of students who participated only once (see
Table S1 in the online supplemental materials for more detailed
results).
We assessed n /H110053,123 fifth-grade students (M
age /H1100511.14,
SD /H110050.59; 131 classes) and n /H110052,484 eighth-grade students

were male. 28% had a migration background, meaning that at least
one parent or the students themselves were not born in Germany.
Students’ socioeconomic status was indicated by the highest value
of the international socioeconomicindex of occupational status in
the family (Ganzeboom, de Graaf, & Treiman, 1992), and was"
2018 - Social Support and Classroom Management Are Related to Secondary Students’ General School Adjustment.pdf,"45.52 on average (SD /H1100512.89). This value is calculated based
on parents’ occupation and integrates information on both in-
come and education. Values can range from 16 /H11005cleaner to
90 /H11005judge. Students attended a comprehensive school (n /H110052,155),
a lower track school (n /H110051,991), or an intermediate track school
(n /H110051,461).
The classes’ homeroom teachers participated (N /H11005211) in
addition to the students. In Germany, not only do homeroom
teachers see their students every day, they also have a counseling
function and usually accompany their class for at least 2 years.
Homeroom teachers take on this role in all school types included
in our study. On average, homeroom teachers spent 10.48 lessons
each week with their class (SD /H110055.44): The average number of
lessons was 6.52 (SD /H110052.47) in comprehensive schools, 8.00
(SD /H110052.34) in intermediate track schools, and 16.06 (SD /H110054.11)
in lower track schools. At the second measurement point, most
of the homeroom teachers had been teaching their class for at
least 1 year, but some (15%) had only been teaching their class
for 3 months. The teachers were on average 45.14 years old
(SD /H1100510.09), had 19.74 years of job experience (SD /H1100511.00),
and 30% were male.
Instruments
Students and teachers evaluated classroom management and
social support on a 4-point scale ranging from 1/H11005completely
disagree to 4/H11005completely agree. The items are displayed inTable
A1 in theAppendix A. Most items were adopted fromBaumert et
al. (2008); two items for social support were newly developed on
the basis of the concept of transformational leadership (Bass,
1990) to measure the extent to which teachers believed in their
students’ future. Students’ school adjustment was assessed broad-
ly: Achievement was measured with standardized tests; truancy,
school satisfaction, and self-esteem were assessed via student
report. The items are included inAppendix B.
Classroom management. Six items assessed the lack of dis-
ciplinary problems and disruptions in class as an indicator of
efficient classroom management. Based on the results from ex-
ploratory factor analyses (see Results section), one item was ex-
cluded from this scale for the data analyses ( /H9251
teacher /H11005.79;
/H9251student /H11005.83).
Social support. Teachers’ patience and help regarding content
learning as well as their appreciation of and personal interest in
their students were measured with eight items (/H9251
teacher /H11005.81;
/H9251student /H11005.93).
Truancy. Six types of truancy (/H9251t1 /H11005.92, /H9251t2 /H11005.93) were
measured on a scale from 1/H11005never,2 /H11005two or three times,3 /H11005
three or four timesto 4 /H11005five times or more.
School satisfaction. Students’ enjoyment and effort with re-
spect toschool were assessed with seven items (/H9251t1 /H11005.79, /H9251t2 /H11005.79)
by Baumert, Gruehn, Heyn, Köller, and Schnabel (1997)on a 4-point
scale ranging from 1/H11005completely disagreeto 4/H11005completely agree.
Self-esteem. Four items (/H9251t1 /H11005.73, /H9251t2 /H11005.75) by Ravens-
Sieberer and Bullinger (2000) were used to measure the stu-
dents’ appraisal of their own value on a 5-point scale ranging
from 1 /H11005never to 5 /H11005always.
Achievement. Mathematics and German achievement were
assessed via standardized achievement tests that were administered
via a longitudinal balanced incomplete booklet design with anchor
items. The tests covered standard content from the federal states’
curricula in German and mathematics: The German test included
several short texts to measure reading comprehension with a total
of 60–76 items depending on the measurement point and student
cohort (for a more detailed description see alsoDumont, Trau-
twein, Nagy, & Nagengast, 2014). The mathematics test comprised
73–84 items covering grade-specific content such as arithmetic
rules, the metric system, or linear equations. All items had an
open-ended, closed-ended, or multiple-choice format. Item and
person parameters for students’ mathematics and German compe-
tence were estimated with a longitudinal, multidimensional two-
parameter item response theory model. Unidimensionality, mea-
surement invariance across different subpopulations (school type,
gender), and partial measurement invariance across measurement
points (Jonkmann et al., 2013) as well as reliability and validity
were assured (/H9251/H11350.70 for both achievement domains and both
cohorts; standardized mean difference between school years:
0.17 /H11349d /H113490.34). For further statistical analyses, we used
weighted likelihood estimates of students’ academic competence.
Thereby, we standardized the weighted likelihood estimates scores
for each test separately to assure comparability across subjects and
cohorts.
To be able to investigate whether student achievement in Ger-
man/mathematics is related to the social support and classroom
management provided in these subject domains, we calculated an
achievement variable on the basis of students’ mathematics
achievement when the homeroom teacher taught mathematics,
German achievement when the homeroom teacher taught German,
and the average of both tests when the homeroom teacher taught
both subjects. We included only a subsample of n /H11005169
teachers who taught German and/or mathematics and their
students (n /H110054,151) in the analyses regarding student achieve-
ment. The total sample was used for all other student outcomes.
Covariates. All outcome variables were assessed at both mea-
surement points so that we could control for the baseline level. In
addition, we used gender (0 /H11005female, 1 /H11005male), migration
background (0 /H11005no migration background, 1 /H11005migration
background), and socioeconomic background as covariates at
the student level. At the class level, we controlled for cohort
(0 /H11005fifth/sixth grade, 1 /H11005eighth/ninth grade) and created two
dummy variables for school type (lower: 0/H11005other, 1 /H11005lower
track; intermediate: 0 /H11005other, 1 /H11005intermediate track).
Data Analyses
As we were interested in investigating effects at both the student
and the class level, we applied multilevel modeling (Raudenbush
& Bryk, 2002). To test whether the factorial structure for social
support and classroom management was equal at the student and
the class level as well as for student and teacher ratings, we
proceeded as suggested byMuthén (1994). Thereby, student and
teacher ratings were included in a joint model and the factor
indicators were treated as continuous variables
1 (Little, 2013).
1 Results from the MCFA and MSEMs were almost identical when the
factor indicators were treated as categorical variables using Bayesian
estimation in Mplus (Muthén, & Asparouhov, 2012). Results from these
analyses can be retrieved from the online supplemental materials (Figure
S1 and Table S2).

1071TEACHER BEHAVIOR, STUDENTS AND SCHOOL ADJUSTMENT","45.52 on average (SD ). This value is calculated based
on parents’ occupation and integrates information on both in-
come and education. Values can range from 16 to
90 judge. Students attended a comprehensive school (n 2,155),
a lower track school (n 1,991), or an intermediate track school
(n 1,461).
The classes’ homeroom teachers participated (N 211) in
addition to the students. In Germany, not only do homeroom
teachers see their students every day, they also have a counseling
function and usually accompany their class for at least 2 years.
Homeroom teachers take on this role in all school types included
in our study. On average, homeroom teachers spent 10.48 lessons
each week with their class (SD 5.44): The average number of
lessons was 6.52 (SD 2.47) in comprehensive schools, 8.00
(SD 2.34) in intermediate track schools, and 16.06 (SD 4.11)
in lower track schools. At the second measurement point, most
of the homeroom teachers had been teaching their class for at
least 1 year, but some (15%) had only been teaching their class
for 3 months. The teachers were on average 45.14 years old
(SD 10.09), had 19.74 years of job experience (SD 11.00),
and 30% were male.
Instruments
Students and teachers evaluated classroom management and
social support on a 4-point scale ranging from 1completely
disagree to 4completely agree. The items are displayed inTable
A1 in theAppendix A. Most items were adopted fromBaumert et
al. (2008); two items for social support were newly developed on
the basis of the concept of transformational leadership (Bass,
1990) to measure the extent to which teachers believed in their
students’ future. Students’ school adjustment was assessed broad-
ly: Achievement was measured with standardized tests; truancy,
school satisfaction, and self-esteem were assessed via student
report. The items are included inAppendix B.
Classroom management. Six items assessed the lack of dis-
ciplinary problems and disruptions in class as an indicator of
efficient classroom management. Based on the results from ex-
ploratory factor analyses (see Results section), one item was ex-
cluded from this scale for the data analyses ( teacher .79;
student .83).
Social support. Teachers’ patience and help regarding content
learning as well as their appreciation of and personal interest in
their students were measured with eight items ( teacher .81;
student .93).
Truancy. Six types of truancy (t1 .92, t2 .93) were
measured on a scale from 1never,2 two or three times,3
three or four timesto 4 five times or more.
School satisfaction. Students’ enjoyment and effort with re-
spect toschool were assessed with seven items (t1 .79, t2 .79)
by Baumert, Gruehn, Heyn, Köller, and Schnabel (1997)on a 4-point
scale ranging from 1completely disagreeto 4completely agree.
Self-esteem. Four items (t1 .73, t2 .75) by Ravens-
Sieberer and Bullinger (2000) were used to measure the stu-
dents’ appraisal of their own value on a 5-point scale ranging
from 1 never to 5 always.
Achievement. Mathematics and German achievement were
assessed via standardized achievement tests that were administered
via a longitudinal balanced incomplete booklet design with anchor
items. The tests covered standard content from the federal states’
curricula in German and mathematics: The German test included
several short texts to measure reading comprehension with a total
of 60–76 items depending on the measurement point and student
cohort (for a more detailed description see alsoDumont, Trau-
twein, Nagy, & Nagengast, 2014). The mathematics test comprised
73–84 items covering grade-specific content such as arithmetic
rules, the metric system, or linear equations. All items had an
open-ended, closed-ended, or multiple-choice format. Item and
person parameters for students’ mathematics and German compe-
tence were estimated with a longitudinal, multidimensional two-
parameter item response theory model. Unidimensionality, mea-
surement invariance across different subpopulations (school type,
gender), and partial measurement invariance across measurement
points (Jonkmann et al., 2013) as well as reliability and validity
were assured ( .70 for both achievement domains and both
cohorts; standardized mean difference between school years:
0.17 d 0.34). For further statistical analyses, we used
weighted likelihood estimates of students’ academic competence.
Thereby, we standardized the weighted likelihood estimates scores
for each test separately to assure comparability across subjects and
cohorts.
To be able to investigate whether student achievement in Ger-
man/mathematics is related to the social support and classroom
management provided in these subject domains, we calculated an
achievement variable on the basis of students’ mathematics
achievement when the homeroom teacher taught mathematics,
German achievement when the homeroom teacher taught German,
and the average of both tests when the homeroom teacher taught
both subjects. We included only a subsample of n 169
teachers who taught German and/or mathematics and their
students (n 4,151) in the analyses regarding student achieve-
ment. The total sample was used for all other student outcomes.
Covariates. All outcome variables were assessed at both mea-
surement points so that we could control for the baseline level. In
addition, we used gender (0 female, 1 male), migration
background (0 no migration background, 1 migration
background), and socioeconomic background as covariates at
the student level. At the class level, we controlled for cohort
(0 fifth/sixth grade, 1 eighth/ninth grade) and created two
dummy variables for school type (lower: 0other, 1 lower
track; intermediate: 0 other, 1 intermediate track).

As we were interested in investigating effects at both the student
and the class level, we applied multilevel modeling (Raudenbush
& Bryk, 2002). To test whether the factorial structure for social
support and classroom management was equal at the student and

analyses can be retrieved from the online supplemental materials (Figure
S1 and Table S2)."
2018 - Social Support and Classroom Management Are Related to Secondary Students’ General School Adjustment.pdf,"First, we investigated the factor structure separately at each level
using exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) with oblique geomin
rotation. Next, we applied multilevel confirmatory factor analysis
(MCFA; seeLam, Ruzek, Schenke, Conley, & Karabenick, 2015,
for an application of MCFA to student ratings). Each item only
loaded on the factor expected, and the residuals of parallel items on
the student and teacher questionnaires were allowed to correlate
(Little, 2013). To evaluate model fit, we followedHu and Bentler
(1999) and considered Tucker–Lewis index (TLI) and confirma-
tory fit index (CFI) values/H11350.95, root mean square error of ap-
proximation (RMSEA) values/H11349.06, and standardized root mean
square residual (SRMR) values/H11349.08 as indicative of good model
fit. To compare different models, we evaluated changes in CFI and
assumed the fit of two models to be equivalent when/H9004CFI /H11349–.01
(Cheung & Rensvold, 2002).
We used multilevel structural equation models (MSEMs) as
proposed by Marsh et al. (2009)to predict truancy, school satis-
faction, self-esteem, and achievement. MSEMs have the advantage
of simultaneously controlling for measurement error and sampling
error. To control for measurement error at the student and the class
level, classroom management and social support were measured
with multiple indicators at both levels. To control for sampling
error, the class mean was treated as a latent variable which was
estimated by correcting the aggregated manifest class mean for its
unreliability. We set up a series of random intercept MSEMs.
Model A included classroom management and social support and
controlled for the background variables (gender, migration back-
ground, socioeconomic status, school type, cohort). In Model B,
the baseline level of the outcome variable was additionally entered
to investigate the association between teachers’ interpersonal be-
havior and change in the outcome variables. Another advantage of
including the baseline level is that it controls for students’ indi-
vidual rater tendencies to some extent (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, &
Podsakoff, 2012). In these models, we group mean-centered social
support and classroom management, which allowed us to disen-
tangle within-class and between-class effects of social support and
classroom management on student outcomes (Lüdtke et al., 2009).
The covariates gender, socioeconomic status, and migration back-
ground, and the baseline measures of the outcome variables were
added at Level 1 and were grand-mean centered to adjust for
individual differences between classes. The EFAs, MCFA, and
MSEMs were analyzed with Mplus 7 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–
2012) using maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard
errors.
As in most empirical studies, we had to deal with missing data.
Two different types of missing data occurred: (a) complete lack of
participation at a given measurement point, and (b) missing values
on single items or scales. This resulted in 18% missing values on
average in the student questionnaire and 8% missing values in the
teacher questionnaire. To avoid listwise deletion, missing data
were handled using full information maximum likelihood estima-
tion (Enders, 2010).
Results
Preliminary Analyses
The means, standard deviations, intraclass correlations, and
correlations for social support, classroom management, and
student outcomes at the second measurement point are dis-
played in Table 1. The means indicate that students (M /H110053.07)
and teachers (M /H110053.52) perceived high levels of social support.
Interestingly, no teacher reported a degree of support below the
theoretical mean. This resulted in a reduction in variance, which
should be borne in mind when interpreting the results. Class-
room management ratings were around the scale’s midpoint
(M
student /H110052.50, Mteacher /H110052.70). As the intraclass correlation
shows, 20% and 24% of the variance in student ratings of
classroom management and social support, respectively, could
be attributed to differences between classrooms.
The correlations showed statistically significant and moderate
associations between teacher-rated classroom management and
achievement (r /H11005.20, p /H11005.01), but no association between
teacher-rated social support and student outcomes (.02/H11349r /H11349.06).
Student-rated classroom management and social support had sta-
tistically significant, small to moderate associations with all out-
comes at the student level. At the class level, classroom manage-
ment was moderately linked to truancy (r /H11005–.27, p /H11005.01) and

Classroom Management and Social Support as Key
Dimensions of Teachers’ Interpersonal Behavior
Our first research question aimed to investigate whether the
same factorial structure holds for student and teacher ratings at the
class level as well as for student ratings at the student level. Results
of EFA at the student level implied a two-factor solution (first five
eigenvalues: 5.97, 2.39, 0.75, 0.63, 0.54). Items assessingclass-
room management loaded on the first factor (.51/H11349/H9261/H11349.77),
whereas items related tosocial supportloaded on the second factor
(.68 /H11349/H9261/H11349.80), and cross loadings were small (.00/H11349|/H9261| /H11349.25).
At the class level, where both student and teacher ratings were
included, EFA indicated a five-factor solution (first six eigenval-
ues: 11.10, 4.13, 3.73, 1.71, 1.10, 0.86). As the five-factor model
did not converge, we retained a four-factor model. The first factor
comprised items measuringclassroom management from the stu-
dent perspective. Items measuringsocial supportfrom the teacher
perspective had their highest loading on the second factor. The
third factor represented teacher-rated classroom management,
whereas the fourth factor was related to student-ratedsocial sup-
port. Cross loadings were small for student ratings and below/H9261/H11005
.30 for all but one teacher-rated item. This item was excluded
2
from all further analyses for both teachers and students to keep
items on the classroom management factor parallel. Factor load-
ings for the EFA at the class level are displayed inTable A1in the
Appendix A.
We next used MCFA to provide further support for a model with
two factors at the student level (student-ratedsocial support and
classroom management) and four factors at the class level (student-/
teacher-ratedsocial supportand classroom management). The model
exhibited acceptable fit (/H9273
2 /H110051,815.99,df /H11005344, CFI/H11005.95, TLI/H11005
.94, RMSEA/H11005.03, SRMRwithin /H11005.06, SRMRbetween /H11005.08; see M2
in Table 2) that was superior to a model with only one factor at the
student level and two factors at the class level in which the first factor
comprised all student-rated items and the second factor all teacher-
rated items (/H9273
2 /H110057,826.66, df /H11005350, CFI /H11005.73, TLI /H11005.69,
RMSEA /H11005.06, SRMRw /H11005.12, SRMRb /H11005.16; see M1 inTable 2).
As can be seen inFigure 1, correlations between student-rated social
support and classroom management were substantial at the student
(r /H11005.43, p /H11021.001) and the class level (r /H11005.60, p /H11021.001). In contrast,
social support and classroom management were only weakly corre-
lated in teacher reports (r /H11005.12, p /H11005.10).
In a last step, we tested measurement invariance across cohorts as
well as cross-level measurement invariance of the student ratings, that
is, invariance of the factor loadings across levels (Marsh et al., 2009).
Therefore, we constrained the factor loadings to be equal across
cohorts or levels of analyses. As the fit indices inTable 2show, the
model fits of the invariant models were similar to the models where
the loadings were allowed to vary. Because/H9004CFI was less than –.01
in both cases, we assumed that measurement invariance holds for
student and teacher ratings across cohorts (see M4 vs. M5,Table 2)
and for student ratings across levels (cross-level measurement invari-
ance; see M2 vs. M3,Table 2).
Convergence Between the Teacher and
Student Perspectives
Our second research question concerned the extent to which
student and teacher ratings of social support and classroom man-

and teacher ratings of social support and classroom management
could clearly be separated as distinct factors. Hence, students and
teachers perceived perspective-specific aspects. Nonetheless,Fig-
ure 1 shows that there was a large latent correlation between
student- and teacher-rated classroom management ( r /H11005.47,
p /H11021.001). In contrast, the latent correlation for social support was
small and not statistically significant (r /H11005.11, p /H11005.19).
Classroom Management, Social Support, and
School Adjustment
The third and central aim of the present study was to investigate
the associations between homeroom teachers’ social support and
classroom management as perceived by students and teachers on
the one hand and students’ school adjustment on the other hand.
The results of our MSEMs are displayed inTable 3; the models
showed satisfactory fit (Table 2; M6–M9). We describe results at
the student level first and then present findings at the class level.
At the student level, we first see that student characteristics
notably contribute to their school adjustment (see Model A). For
instance, students with a migration background had higher school
satisfaction (B /H110050.09, p /H11005.03) and self-esteem (B /H110050.11,
p /H11005.02), but lower achievement (B /H11005/H110020.18, p /H11021.001). More-
over, their self-esteem exhibited a more positive development than
that of students without a migration background ( B /H110050.10,
p /H11005.02). Boys reported higher self-esteem (B /H110050.23, p /H11021.001)
and truancy (B /H110050.16, p /H11021.001), but lower school satisfaction
(B /H11005/H110020.27, p /H11021.001) than girls. Whereas boys’ self-esteem
developed more positively, their school satisfaction, truancy, and
achievement levels showed less favorable changes compared to
girls. Beyond these background variables, students’ individual
perceptions of their homeroom teachers’ interpersonal behavior
were associated with their school adjustment. Social support was
statistically significantly related to school satisfaction (B /H110050.28,
p /H11021.001), self-esteem (B /H110050.15, p /H11021.001), truancy (B /H11005/H110020.15,
p /H11021.001), and achievement (B /H110050.07, p /H11005.01). This means
that—when comparing students within the same classroom—the
students who perceived their teacher to be more supportive had
higher achievement, school satisfaction, and self-esteem and were
less truant.
To investigate whether social support and classroom manage-
ment predicted changes in student outcomes, we added students’
baseline level of each outcome. As the results from Model B show,
social support was associated with students’ individual school
satisfaction, self-esteem, truancy, and achievement above and be-
yond their prior school adjustment (school satisfaction:B /H110050.20,
p /H11021.001; self-esteem:B /H110050.11, p /H11021.001; truancy:B /H11005/H110020.13,
p /H11021.001; achievement:
B /H110050.05, p /H11005.04). Furthermore, students

However, the association between teacher-rated classroom management
and school satisfaction and student achievement was only marginally
significant (see Table S5 in the online supplemental materials).

1073TEACHER BEHAVIOR, STUDENTS AND SCHOOL ADJUSTMENT","Classroom Management and Social Support as Key
Dimensions of Teachers’ Interpersonal Behavior
Our first research question aimed to investigate whether the
same factorial structure holds for student and teacher ratings at the
class level as well as for student ratings at the student level. Results
of EFA at the student level implied a two-factor solution (first five
eigenvalues: 5.97, 2.39, 0.75, 0.63, 0.54). Items assessingclass-
room management loaded on the first factor (.77),
whereas items related tosocial supportloaded on the second factor
(.80), and cross loadings were small (.25).
At the class level, where both student and teacher ratings were
included, EFA indicated a five-factor solution (first six eigenval-
ues: 11.10, 4.13, 3.73, 1.71, 1.10, 0.86). As the five-factor model
did not converge, we retained a four-factor model. The first factor
comprised items measuringclassroom management from the stu-
dent perspective. Items measuringsocial supportfrom the teacher
perspective had their highest loading on the second factor. The
third factor represented teacher-rated classroom management,
whereas the fourth factor was related to student-ratedsocial sup-
port. Cross loadings were small for student ratings and below
.30 for all but one teacher-rated item. This item was excluded
from all further analyses for both teachers and students to keep
items on the classroom management factor parallel. Factor load-
ings for the EFA at the class level are displayed inTable A1in the
Appendix A.
We next used MCFA to provide further support for a model with
two factors at the student level (student-ratedsocial support and
classroom management) and four factors at the class level (student-/
teacher-ratedsocial supportand classroom management). The model
exhibited acceptable fit (
2 1,815.99,df 344, CFI.95, TLI
.94, RMSEA.03, SRMRwithin .06, SRMRbetween .08; see M2
in Table 2) that was superior to a model with only one factor at the
student level and two factors at the class level in which the first factor
comprised all student-rated items and the second factor all teacher-
rated items (
2 7,826.66, df 350, CFI .73, TLI .69,
RMSEA .06, SRMRw .12, SRMRb .16; see M1 inTable 2).
As can be seen inFigure 1, correlations between student-rated social
support and classroom management were substantial at the student
(r .43, p .001) and the class level (r .60, p .001). In contrast,
social support and classroom management were only weakly corre-
lated in teacher reports (r .12, p .10).
In a last step, we tested measurement invariance across cohorts as
well as cross-level measurement invariance of the student ratings, that
is, invariance of the factor loadings across levels.
Therefore, we constrained the factor loadings to be equal across
cohorts or levels of analyses. As the fit indices inTable 2show, the
model fits of the invariant models were similar to the models where
the loadings were allowed to vary. BecauseCFI was less than –.01
in both cases, we assumed that measurement invariance holds for
student and teacher ratings across cohorts (see M4 vs. M5,Table 2)
and for student ratings across levels (cross-level measurement invari-
ance; see M2 vs. M3,Table 2).
Convergence Between the Teacher and
Student Perspectives
Our second research question concerned the extent to which
student and teacher ratings of social support and classroom man-
agement converged. As the results of the MCFA indicate, student
and teacher ratings of social support and classroom management
could clearly be separated as distinct factors. Hence, students and
teachers perceived perspective-specific aspects. Nonetheless,Fig-
ure 1 shows that there was a large latent correlation between
student- and teacher-rated classroom management ( r .47,
p .001). In contrast, the latent correlation for social support was
small and not statistically significant (r .11, p .19).
Classroom Management, Social Support, and
School Adjustment
The third and central aim of the present study was to investigate
the associations between homeroom teachers’ social support and
classroom management as perceived by students and teachers on
the one hand and students’ school adjustment on the other hand.
The results of our MSEMs are displayed inTable 3; the models
showed satisfactory fit (Table 2; M6–M9). We describe results at
the student level first and then present findings at the class level.
At the student level, we first see that student characteristics
notably contribute to their school adjustment (see Model A). For
instance, students with a migration background had higher school
satisfaction (B 0.09, p .03) and self-esteem (B 0.11,
p .02), but lower achievement (B –0.18, p .001). More-
over, their self-esteem exhibited a more positive development than
that of students without a migration background ( B 0.10,
p .02). Boys reported higher self-esteem (B 0.23, p .001)
and truancy (B 0.16, p .001), but lower school satisfaction
(B –0.27, p .001) than girls. Whereas boys’ self-esteem
developed more positively, their school satisfaction, truancy, and
achievement levels showed less favorable changes compared to
girls. Beyond these background variables, students’ individual
perceptions of their homeroom teachers’ interpersonal behavior
were associated with their school adjustment. Social support was
statistically significantly related to school satisfaction (B 0.28,
p .001), self-esteem (B 0.15, p .001), truancy (B –0.15,
p .001), and achievement (B 0.07, p .01). This means
that—when comparing students within the same classroom—the
students who perceived their teacher to be more supportive had
higher achievement, school satisfaction, and self-esteem and were
less truant.
To investigate whether social support and classroom manage-
ment predicted changes in student outcomes, we added students’
baseline level of each outcome. As the results from Model B show,
social support was associated with students’ individual school
satisfaction, self-esteem, truancy, and achievement above and be-

more favorable development regarding school satisfaction (B /H11005

their classmates. However, the standardized coefficients were
rather small.
At the class level, background variables were again associated
with students’ school adjustment: Classes in the second cohort
(ninth grade) had lower school satisfaction (B /H11005/H110020.22, p /H11021.001)
than students in the first cohort (sixth grade). Furthermore, they
attained smaller learning gains (B /H11005/H110020.40, p /H11021.001) and their
truancy (B /H110050.27, p /H11021.001) increased more than among students
in the first cohort. Moreover, classes differed depending on school
type, and most of these differences became more pronounced over
time. Compared to classes in comprehensive schools, classes in the
lower track (B /H110050.15, p /H11005.002) and in the intermediate track
(B /H110050.12, p /H11005.01) were more satisfied with school. Classes in
the intermediate track reported higher self-esteem ( B /H110050.14,
p /H11021.001), whereas classes in the lower track were more truant
(B /H110050.21, p /H11021.001) and learned less (B /H11005/H110020.29, p /H11021.001).
Social support and classroom management were also linked to
general school adjustment at the class level, but the pattern of
results differed from that at the student level. For social support,
we found that classes that felt more supported by their teachers
showed higher school satisfaction (B /H110050.19, p /H11005.002) and
self-esteem (B /H110050.11, p /H11005.02). However, the associations were
no longer statistically significant when the baseline measurement
was included. This means that social support was not related to
student outcomes at the class level after controlling for students’
prior adjustment. Teacher-rated classroom management was sta-
tistically significantly linked to school satisfaction (B /H110050.06, p /H11005
.03) in Model A.
Furthermore, it was statistically significantly asso-
ciated with increases in student achievement (B /H110050.05, p /H11005.05). In
addition, student-rated classroom management was statistically sig-

p /H11005.02). Hence, classes that were rated by students as well-managed
developed more positively in terms of truancy. We also tested whether
the pattern of results changed when we included either student or
teacher ratings at the class level. The most notable difference was that
student-rated classroom management was now statistically signifi-
cantly associated with changes in student achievement at the class
level (seeTable S4in the online supplemental materials).
Finally, we specified multiple group models and used chi-square
difference tests (Little, 2013) to assess whether the associations
were similar across cohorts. Thereby, we allowed the coefficients
of student- and teacher-rated classroom management and social
support on the outcome variables to vary freely across cohorts and
found the relations to be similar. Furthermore, the findings were
robust when we did not assume cross-level invariance of the factor
loadings (see Table S3 in the online supplemental materials).
Discussion
The present study investigated whether homeroom teachers’
social support and classroom management are related to secondary
students’ achievement and, beyond that, their domain-independent,
general school adjustment in terms of school satisfaction, self-
esteem, and truancy. We drew on student and teacher ratings of
classroom management and social support and applied MSEMs to
simultaneously investigate associations at the student and the class
level. In support of our hypotheses, the results showed that class-
room management and social support were empirically distin-
guishable constructs regardless of the level of analysis and whether
the student or teacher perspective was being considered. Thereby,
student and teacher ratings of social support and classroom man-
agement could be clearly separated as distinct factors at the class
level. In addition, student and teacher ratings of classroom man-
agement were substantially correlated, whereas their perceptions
of social support were largely unrelated. Regarding the relation-
ship between social support, classroom management and school
adjustment, we found that students’ idiosyncratic interpretations of
social support were particularly closely linked to their outcomes:
Students who felt more supported compared to their classmates
developed more positively in terms of school satisfaction, self-
esteem, truancy, and achievement. At the class level, relations
were more heterogeneous: Student-rated social support was linked
to more school satisfaction and self-esteem, and student-rated
classroom management was related to lower truancy. Furthermore,
teacher-rated classroom management was associated with higher
achievement and school satisfaction.
Classroom Management and Social Support as Key
Dimensions of Teachers’ Interpersonal Behavior
Theoretically and empirically, classroom management and so-
cial support represent two central and distinct dimensions of teach-
ers’ interpersonal behavior (Hamre et al., 2013; Wubbels, Brekel-
mans, et al., 1993). However, student and teacher ratings and
analyses at the student and the class level have rarely been com-
bined. Therefore, it was unclear whether the same factorial struc-
ture would emerge across different levels and perspectives—de-
spite the fact that this is an important precondition of gathering
valid findings. Moreover, prior studies were mostly conducted in
elementary schools or with mathematics classes (e.g.,Downer et
al., 2014; Kunter & Baumert, 2006). Therefore, our results com-
plemented these studies and validated the factorial structure across
levels and perspectives in a sample of secondary school students.

1075TEACHER BEHAVIOR, STUDENTS AND SCHOOL ADJUSTMENT","nificantly linked to truancy beyond the baseline level (B /H11005/H110020.13,
p /H11005.02). Hence, classes that were rated by students as well-managed
developed more positively in terms of truancy. We also tested whether
the pattern of results changed when we included either student or
teacher ratings at the class level. The most notable difference was that
student-rated classroom management was now statistically signifi-
cantly associated with changes in student achievement at the class
level (seeTable S4in the online supplemental materials).
Finally, we specified multiple group models and used chi-square
difference tests (Little, 2013) to assess whether the associations
were similar across cohorts. Thereby, we allowed the coefficients
of student- and teacher-rated classroom management and social
support on the outcome variables to vary freely across cohorts and
found the relations to be similar. Furthermore, the findings were
robust when we did not assume cross-level invariance of the factor
loadings (see Table S3 in the online supplemental materials).
Discussion
The present study investigated whether homeroom teachers’
social support and classroom management are related to secondary
students’ achievement and, beyond that, their domain-independent,
general school adjustment in terms of school satisfaction, self-
esteem, and truancy. We drew on student and teacher ratings of
classroom management and social support and applied MSEMs to
simultaneously investigate associations at the student and the class
level. In support of our hypotheses, the results showed that class-
room management and social support were empirically distin-
guishable constructs regardless of the level of analysis and whether
the student or teacher perspective was being considered. Thereby,
student and teacher ratings of social support and classroom man-
agement could be clearly separated as distinct factors at the class
level. In addition, student and teacher ratings of classroom man-
agement were substantially correlated, whereas their perceptions
of social support were largely unrelated. Regarding the relation-
ship between social support, classroom management and school
adjustment, we found that students’ idiosyncratic interpretations of
social support were particularly closely linked to their outcomes:
Students who felt more supported compared to their classmates
developed more positively in terms of school satisfaction, self-
esteem, truancy, and achievement. At the class level, relations
were more heterogeneous: Student-rated social support was linked
to more school satisfaction and self-esteem, and student-rated
classroom management was related to lower truancy. Furthermore,
teacher-rated classroom management was associated with higher
achievement and school satisfaction.
Classroom Management and Social Support as Key
Dimensions of Teachers’ Interpersonal Behavior
Theoretically and empirically, classroom management and so-
cial support represent two central and distinct dimensions of teach-
ers’ interpersonal behavior (Hamre et al., 2013; Wubbels, Brekel-
mans, et al., 1993). However, student and teacher ratings and
analyses at the student and the class level have rarely been com-
bined. Therefore, it was unclear whether the same factorial struc-
ture would emerge across different levels and perspectives—de-
spite the fact that this is an important precondition of gathering
valid findings. Moreover, prior studies were mostly conducted in
elementary schools or with mathematics classes (e.g.,Downer et
al., 2014; Kunter & Baumert, 2006). Therefore, our results com-
plemented these studies and validated the factorial structure across
levels and perspectives in a sample of secondary school students.

2018 - Social Support and Classroom Management Are Related to Secondary Students’ General School Adjustment.pdf,"Convergence Between the Teacher and
Student Perspectives
The question of whether different informants generate the same
information about teaching processes has often been raised (Desi-
mone, Smith, & Frisvold, 2010; Turner & Meyer, 2000). In this
study, students and teachers provided similar information regard-
ing classroom management, but, a meaningful proportion of vari-
ance was uniquely tied to each perspective, such that teacher- and
student-rated classroom management could be distinguished as
two separate factors at the class level. Consequently, students and
teachers perceived classroom management somewhat differently,
which is an important precondition of perspective-specific validi-
ties in predicting student outcomes. In contrast, there appeared to
be virtually no relationship between students’ and teachers’ per-
ceptions of social support. Searching for possible explanations, we
noted that all teachers rated their own social support rather posi-
tively. This reduction in variance makes it difficult to discover
substantial correlations, and this also needs to be considered with
respect to the association between teacher-rated support and stu-
dent outcomes. However, our findings also raise the question of
whether teachers and students actually refer to the same underlying
construct when rating identical items about teacher social support,
and we can only speculate about why their evaluations of social
support do not overlap. We assume that student perceptions actu-
ally reflect observable differences in whether the teacher responds
to students’ personal and learning needs. After all, a study that
applied student ratings and classroom observations of social sup-
port found substantial convergence between student and observer
perspectives (Downer et al., 2014). In contrast, teachers may refer
to their teaching ideals rather than their actual behaviors (Kopcha
& Sullivan, 2007). After all, providing social support to students is
particularly closely connected to teachers’ identity, because social
interests are a major reason for choosing the teaching profession
(Roloff Henoch, Klusmann, Lüdtke, & Trautwein, 2015). There-
fore, social support may be especially prone to self-serving strat-
egies (Wubbels, Brekelmans, et al., 1993), and it might be harder
for teachers to admit having difficulties with social support com-
pared to other aspects of teaching, such as classroom management.
Classroom management problems can be ascribed to the class
instead of one’s own competence (Kulinna, 2007). Moreover,
classroom management can be observed more easily than social
support, which could facilitate more objective judgments. For
instance, successful classroom management can be immediately
inferred from the extent of student behavior problems, whereas
students’ personal and learning needs are less evident to teachers
(Kunter & Voss, 2013).
Classroom Management, Social Support, and
School Adjustment
The main purpose of the present study was to investigate
whether homeroom teachers’ classroom management and social
support were related to secondary students’ general school adjust-
ment. Our findings not only support the numerous stories of
teachers who make a difference for students far beyond their
specific subject (Pajares & Urdan, 2008), but are also in line with
theoretical assumptions that teachers’ interpersonal behavior is
associated with student development (e.g., self-determination the-
ory; Ryan & Deci, 2000).
Even though our findings largely matched our expectations,
there are some interesting results that need further explanation.
First, social support was related to positive developments in school
satisfaction, self-esteem, truancy, and achievement at the student
level, whereas social support was not linked to student outcomes at
the class level beyond their baseline adjustment. In contrast,
student-rated classroom management was related to changes in
truancy at the class level, but associations between students’ idio-
syncratic interpretations and individual school adjustment were
weak. This suggests that differences in students’ perceptions of
social support within a given class apparently carried valuable
information. Students seem to be particularly sensitive to the social
support they perceive in comparison to their classmates and it
appears to be less important for predicting student outcomes
whether the teacher is, on average, more supportive than other
teachers. In light of these findings, earlier work on differential
teacher behavior and the teacher’s pet phenomenon, which indi-
cated that students easily detect subtle nuances in teachers’ emo-
tional relationships with different students, appears to be of great
interest and should be considered in future research (for an over-
view see Babad, 2009). However, more research is needed to
reveal to what extent students’ individual perceptions reflect ob-
jective differences in teacher behavior and subjective interpreta-
tions.
Importantly, these findings also imply that whether students
perceive their classroom to be more or less organized than their
classmates is less important for individual student outcomes.
Therefore, classroom management rather appears to be a class
level construct. At first glance, our finding that teacher-rated, but
not student-rated, classroom management was linked to achieve-
ment at the class level appears contradictory and is not clearly in
line with previous research, which has clearly established a rela-
tionship between student-rated classroom management and
achievement (e.g.,Blank & Shavit, 2016). However, our additional
analyses revealed that student-rated classroom management was
related to changes in student achievement when teacher ratings
were not included in the model (see Table S4 in the online
supplemental materials).This supports the argument of perspective-
specific validities put forward by Kunter and Baumert (2006).
Considering that teacher-rated classroom management was also re-
lated to school satisfaction, our results indicate that teachers are
indeed able to validly evaluate whether or not they have been able to
establish a disciplinary climate where time on task is sufficient to
promote learning, which could also be important for students’ school
satisfaction.
Limitations
The consideration of different perspectives on social support
and classroom management and the use of multilevel modeling in
investigating their unique relationships with a broad range of
student outcomes is a central advantage of the present study.
Nonetheless, some limitations need to be discussed. First, we
focused on German sixth- and ninth-grade students in the voca-
tional track only. One advantage of this sample was that students
remained with the same group of students throughout the school
day so that classroom composition was stable. However, whereas

2018 - Social Support and Classroom Management Are Related to Secondary Students’ General School Adjustment.pdf,"the sampling procedure assured representativeness within the vo-
cational track, our sample was not representative of the total
German student population. Therefore, the relationships between
social support, classroom management, and student development
might vary with different student populations; for example, chil-
dren in primary school may react differently to their relationship
with teachers (Lynch & Cicchetti, 1997; Roorda, Koomen, Spilt, &
Oort, 2011). Likewise, our findings may not be transferable to
countries where secondary school students do not have a teacher
who takes on a role similar to that of German homeroom teachers.
However, our study represents a first step toward investigating the
proximal processes associated with students’ general school ad-
justment. Research in diverse school systems could reveal whether
a certain amount of time or responsibility on behalf of teachers are
necessary to attain results similar to those in our study.
Second, we exclusively focused on teachers’ interpersonal be-
haviors. Even though we controlled for relevant covariates, such as
gender and migration background, we could not include other
possibly relevant features of the classroom environment, such as
content-related aspects of teaching or peer relationships. Thus, we
cannot rule out that the relations found would change if other
classroom environment variables were included.
Third, formulating student and teacher items completely iden-
tically was not feasible, and this might have reduced the correla-
tions between the two perspectives. Moreover, caution is war-
ranted in drawing causal inferences, despite the fact that we
controlled for students’ baseline measures. For instance, it is
possible that students who exhibit increased school satisfaction
will evoke positive reactions from their teacher and receive more
social support (Nurmi & Kiuru, 2015). Relatedly, shared method
bias represents a potential threat to the interpretation of our results
because students rated both teachers’ interpersonal behavior and
the outcome variables self-esteem, school satisfaction, and truancy
which may have inflated the covariances (Podsakoff et al., 2003).
This might be particularly problematic at the student level because
rater tendencies such as leniency or acquiescence cannot be ac-
counted for. However, controlling for students’ baseline outcomes
and conducting analyses at the class level reduced the risk of
shared method bias to some extent (Hoyt, 2000). Furthermore,
studies applying observer ratings and thus avoiding the problem of
shared method bias found observed social support and classroom
management to be related to student-rated engagement in class,
which implies that our findings are not merely attributable to
shared method bias (Reyes, Brackett, Rivers, White, & Salovey,
2012; Rimm-Kaufman, Baroody, Larsen, Curby, & Abry, 2015;
Ruzek et al., 2016).
Implications and Conclusion
The present study represented a first step to extending our
understanding of the significance of homeroom teachers’ social
support and classroom management beyond secondary students’
domain-specific outcomes. Therefore, we want to caution the
reader that more research in diverse contexts is needed to inves-
tigate whether our results can be replicated. Our findings imply
that there is no clear-cut answer to this question and that consid-
ering the perspective of the rater and the level of analysis is of
great importance.
Regarding the question of which rater provides the most valid
information for predicting student outcomes, our findings sup-
ported the usefulness of student ratings. Therefore, recent efforts to
improve teacher evaluation using student surveys should be
strongly encouraged (Raudenbush & Jean, 2014). In addition,
considering teacher ratings of classroom management might also
be worthwhile, because the teacher perspective includes specific
information that is not detected by students and is uniquely asso-
ciated with student achievement and school satisfaction. However,
teacher ratings of social support were mostly independent of what
their students perceived and unrelated to student development.
Therefore, researchers must carefully consider whether student
and/or teacher ratings are best suited for capturing a given con-
struct of interest. Qualitative interviews or thinking-aloud tech-
niques could be an appropriate tool to more profoundly understand
which aspects of social support and classroom management are
assessed in student and teacher ratings and why they are differen-
tially related to student outcomes. In addition, integrating observer
ratings with student and teacher ratings would further expand our
findings on the unique predictive values of different perspectives
(Turner & Meyer, 2000).
Moreover, our results indicate that simultaneous analyses at the
student and the class level represent an interesting avenue for
future research (Lüdtke et al., 2009). Comparisons showed that the
associations between social support, classroom management, and
school adjustment varied considerably between the two levels:
Classroom management largely appeared to be a class level con-
struct, whereas students’ individual perceptions had little predic-
tive power. Social support, in contrast, was predictive of students’
school adjustment at the student level. This finding is compelling
considering the class-level formulation of the items (e.g., “Our
homeroom teacher tries to understandus.”) and the fact that we
controlled for a number of individual student characteristics that
could potentially influence students’ ratings (e.g., gender, migra-
tion background, baseline level of student outcomes at Time 1).
All in all, this challenges the assumption that divergent student
perceptions in the same classroom should be conceptualized as
pure measurement error or rater bias (Raudenbush & Jean, 2014).
Thus, future research would profit from appropriately addressing
both the class level and the student level simultaneously. However,
more research is also needed to investigate why students in the
same classroom perceive social support differently. For example,
student characteristics may systematically affect their perceptions:
for example, girls might perceive higher levels of social support
than boys (Levy, Wubbels, den Brok, & Brekelmans, 2003). Al-
ternatively, these differential perceptions could be rooted in teach-
ers’ differential behaviors toward boys and girls ( Beaman,
Wheldall, & Kemp, 2006). In this regard, classroom observations
could help uncover differences in social support displayed toward
different students.
Finally, further research is needed to learn more about the
relationship between teachers’ interpersonal behavior and diverse
aspects of students’ general school adjustment. For instance, well-
being, school engagement, hope and optimism about one’s future
could be included as additional outcomes because—like self-
esteem, school satisfaction, and reduced truancy—they are in-
creasingly emphasized as central goals of schooling (Lopez &
Calderon, 2011; Ministry of Education, 2014). Moreover, to pro-
mote educational equality, it would be interesting to focus on

make a difference in their lives (Chetty et al., 2010). After all,
these students have been shown to be particularly in need of
positive teacher-student relationships, and having at least one
trusted adult is considered an important protective factor (McGrath
& van Bergen, 2015).
In summary, our results provide new insights for research and
practice. This study underlines the association between homeroom
teachers’ social support and classroom management and secondary
students’ development not only in the specific subjects they teach,
but also with respect to students’ general experiences and behavior
at school. The use of student and teacher ratings and multilevel
structural equation modeling enabled us to discover that the rela-
tionships were particularly pronounced for student-rated social
support at the student level. Thus, it appears to be crucial for
teachers to build positive relationships with every single student
because these relationships are associated with student outcomes
in corresponding subject domains as well as their general school
adjustment.

make a difference in their lives (Chetty et al., 2010). After all,
these students have been shown to be particularly in need of
positive teacher-student relationships, and having at least one
trusted adult is considered an important protective factor (McGrath
& van Bergen, 2015).
In summary, our results provide new insights for research and
practice. This study underlines the association between homeroom
teachers’ social support and classroom management and secondary
students’ development not only in the specific subjects they teach,
but also with respect to students’ general experiences and behavior
at school. The use of student and teacher ratings and multilevel
structural equation modeling enabled us to discover that the rela-
tionships were particularly pronounced for student-rated social
support at the student level. Thus, it appears to be crucial for
teachers to build positive relationships with every single student
because these relationships are associated with student outcomes
in corresponding subject domains as well as their general school
adjustment.
