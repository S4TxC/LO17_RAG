Abstract—The application of online learning has increased significantly, 
recently. One of the key successes in online learning is student interactions.  An 
active learning strategy would engage the students to interact with the course or 
to get involved in the learn ing process. The objective of this research was to 
predict which one of the student activities that would improve the learning 
outcome of the students? All the activities are related to non -human interaction. 
One of the activities is concept mapping. All t he students’  activities in online 
learning were stored in LMS and the data generated as a learning analytics. A 
linear regression method was used to analyze the data. This research confirmed 
that working on exercises by using concept mapping yields significant results in 
improving the learning outcome of students. 
Keywords—Concept mapping, learning analytics, learning outcomes, non-
human interaction, student success in online learning  
1 Introduction 
Nobody denies that education is changing and technology has a big part in 
changing the current educational landscape. In this big data era, online learning usage 
has increased significantly, and has become more popular during the Covid-19 
outbreak, and would be expected to substitute the traditional classroom (face to face 
setting). Therefore, educators should provide quality learning experiences for the 
students. 
In order to promote student success in online learning,  There are several imp ortant 
aspects that need to be considered in organizing online learning such as  the use of 
application software which has many advantages including the ease of administering, 
managing, documenting, monitoring, content delivery, and evaluating online learni ng 
[1], utilization of educational data mining to improve the quality of education [2], as 
well as the application of learner-centered learning strategies [3].

A Learning management system (LMS) is a learning platform that is used to 
administer the educational program in an online learning environment which adopts 
the learning activities of the traditional classroom. An LMS has a common component 
consisting of synchronous a nd asynchronous communication tools, management 
features, and assessment utilities  [4]. These features make the teacher is easier to  
structure the course. Thus, an LMS as a learning environment that is able to support 
both teachers and students to conduct self-directed learning [5].  
An LMS records activity data on the LMS Activity logs. It collects  student 
interaction activities data, such as when, how long and how often they access the 
facilities provided such as content, quiz, forum,  and other facilities. Data generated by 
each online student  and it will be different from each other. The log data generated 
from an LMS is called Learning Analy tics (LA) and its function is to extract data in a 
big volume [6].  
The LA is used to optimize the learning process by solving problems that exist 
within the learning process. The use of data with the aim of determining the righ t 
strategy and policy is known as a data -driven approach. Many problems can be solved 
by utilizing a data-driven approach, as stated by Jagadish, et al [7]. The use of LA can 
create a more personal, adaptive and interactive lear ning environment in order to 
increase the effectiveness in teaching and learning and improve the performance of 
students and teachers [8].  
Responding to the large volume of educational data, it is expected that LA will be 
important equipment in supporting the teacher to have a greater understanding of 
student needs and performances [9]. LA provides meaningful information to teachers 
by combining and analyzing students ’  historical data during learning and then taking 
action to reflect and intervene in learning to increase students ’  absorption and 
participation [10].  
However, the use of LMS and LA alone are not enough without an instructional  
strategy in online learning. An instructional strategy is aimed at increasing activity in 
learning. Student activeness in online learning can be seen from student interaction. In 
an online learning system, it plays an important role  [11]. The student interaction is 
produced by active learning strategies as well . An active learning strategy can 
promote students ’  engagement in order to interact with the course or to become 
involved in the learning process [12].  
This study uses LMS and LA as infrastructure in online learning. In addition, the 
learning activity used is the use of the Concept Mapping (CM) strategy which is one 
of the eight ways to promote generative learning activities [13].  
In addition to CM, reading content s, number of logins, length of login, and 
submitting assignments are online learning activities which are the focus of this 
research. According to Hirumi [14], these activities are categorized  as non-human 
interaction. All the activities were recorded in the LMS and the data pre sented as a 
learning analytics. The purpose of this study was to predict which of these activities 
would affect the learning outcome. Therefore, in this study, an experiment was carried 
out with the test subjects being students of the Educational Technolog y Department, 
State University of Malang. The test results were analyzed using regression analysis 
with multiple linear regression (MLR).

2 Literature Review 
2.1 Active learning strategies in online learning  
Interaction in online l earning: Online learning activ ities combine several 
student’s interaction types during the learning process. Many researches have 
discussed student interaction due to its important role  in online learning. Hirumi  [14] 
has summarized several types of interactions in online learning which consists of 
three levels, namely student self -interaction which relates to cognitive processes 
(level 1), student interactions with human and non -human resources in the learning 
environment (level 2), and student inter action with pedagogy or e -learning strategy 
(level 3). Furthermore, Chou, Peng, and Chang  [15] also define interaction in online 
learning to be the student -self, student -student, student -teacher, student -content, and 
student interface. The more common types of interactions in online learning are stated 
by Gradel and Edson  [16] which consists of student -content, student -teacher, and 
student-student interaction.  Student-tool interaction is also classifie d in student -
interaction as non- human [14], [17]. 
Concept m apping: A student should not only passively receive information or 
knowledge but they must play an active role in constructing their understanding so 
that the learning process is also defined as a generative activity [18]. Generative 
learning is more focused on finding relationships to build new knowledge than just 
storing information in the short term (working memory) or long term memory. Thus, 
in generative learning, understanding is a result of the process of building 
relationships be tween one concept and another with the initial knowledge, learning 
experiences and new information [13].  
According to Fiorella and Mayer  [13], there are eight ways to promote generative 
learning, including learning by mapping. The concept map is an example of part of 
learning by mapping, where students convert their understanding into a spatial 
arrangement of words and make connections between these words. Joseph Novak and 
his team coined  the concept mapping method in the early 1970s.  The Theory of 
Ausable, a meaningful learning theory underpinned the concept mapping theory.  A 
concept map is a way of representing or organizing knowledge. Concept maps 
identify the way we think, and the way we see relationships between knowledge  [19]. 
Novak [20] implies that CM is a method for enhancing conceptual understanding. 
2.2 Learning analytics in Learning Management System (LMS)  
Currently, popular LMS provides essential tools that allow interactive activities in 
the course, such as forums, messages, online forms of assignments, virtual classroom, 
etc. These tools also assist teachers in tracking and monitoring the student learning 
process, such as s tatus submitted assignment reports, the frequency of access 
statistics, activity logs on the system. 
Online learning in higher education is growing dramatically around the globe. With 
the asynchronous and synchronous interaction and communication facilitie s in an 
online learning environment to substitute the traditional classroom approach, this is

what makes online learning a part of higher education.  The implementation of 
Learning Analytics can enhance the quality of an online learning process and 
outcomes due to the fact that it would provide a better understanding of students ’  
performance during the learning process through seeing their learning track records  
[21]. 
LA is a sophisticated tool used to enhance learning an d education. Interestingly, 
LA emerged from several fields of science and previous research such as educational 
data mining, web analytics, business intelligence, as well as academic analytics  [22]. 
LA provides important informa tion to teachers by combining and analyzing students ’  
learning historical data then taking action to reflect and intervene in learning to 
increase students’  absorption of material and participation [23]. 
Data sources in LA can  be in the form of demographic data, online activities, 
assessments and learning achievement data. All data can be visualized in a variety of 
ways. The data are presented to the teachers and students. Clow  [24] states that 
interventions and predictions also vary between teachers and students. They would be 
taking action based on presented LA, for instance, students would compare their 
learning progress and achievement to other peers, and the teacher would contact 
identified students who require some additional assistance.

3.3 Data collection 
Learning analytics data were taken from two tables in the LMS database system, 
namely the login table that records information about stude nt login activities and the 
time duration they spent when using the LMS system. The other table was the session 
table that records every process of student activity when they accessed the LMS with 
the user ID and activity ID.  
After deleting activity data from the teacher and administrator, the data were 
filtered on both tables so that the students ’  activities were obtained. The following 
are students’  activity data consisting of: 
• The number of logins: n1 = 1.139 
• The number of minutes of interaction: n2 = 22.226 
• The number of interactions record: 8.852, with details: 
─ Reading content activity: n3 = 4.733 
─ Working on exercises by building concept mapping activity: n4 = 2.715 
─ Submitting tasks activity n5: 1.404 
The post-test consisted of 25 questions that were validated by experts in the field of 
information technology and educational technology. 
3.4 Data analysis 
Statistical analysis in this study used SPSS version 26 application software. 
Multiple linear regression (MLR) was used to find relationships between several 
online learning activities which were categorized as non -human interactions with 
learning outcomes.. In the context of this study, the independent variable was the 
number of interactions of each type of interaction listed  in Table 2, namely the 
number of logins, the duration of the logins, the duration of reading the content, the 
number of interactions in building the CM  (working on exercises using CM) , as well 
as number of submitting assignments whereas the dependent variable was the learning 
outcome, represented by the final grade (posttest) achieved by each student. The MLR 
method was used to calculate the variance of the dependent variable as a linear 
combination of the independent variables.  Previously, a correlation t est was 
performed to determine the correlation coefficient of each variable. This made it 
possible to create predictive models for dependent variables based on data from 
independent variables.

Table 3 shows the number of logins was closely related to all activities on the LMS 
with a 99% confidence level, however the number of log ins was not related to the 
learning outcomes. Likewise, with the time spent by students in accessing LMS, the 
Spearman correlation test results showed that the time in accessing LMS was closely 
related to all variables tested except for the learning outcomes variables.  
To interpret the MLR measurement results, several analysis of the test results were 
conducted including the F test, T-test, measurement of the coefficient of

Likewise, with the time spent by students in accessing LMS, the Spearman correlation test results showed that the time in accessing LMS was closely related to all variables tested except for the learning outcomes variables.

To interpret the MLR measurement results, several analysis of the test results were conducted including the F test, T-test, measurement of the coefficient of determination, as well as the multicollinearity test. The following is an explanati on regarding the results of several tests that had been carried out.

Based on the F test  as shown in Table 4, the error rate or sig. of 0.002 <0.005 was obtained and the value of Fount was greater than Ftable 2.41. So from these results it was concluded that the independent variable simultaneously affected the dependent variable."

After obtaining the F val ue, the results of the determination coefficient 
measurement was showed (see Table 5). Table 5 shows the R square value of 0.241 
(24.1%) and an adjusted R square of 0.161 (16.1%). Due to  more than two 
independent variables was used, the adjusted R Square was selected as a reference as 
the coefficient of determination. This coefficient showed how much the percentage of 
variation in the independent variable used in the model was able to exp lain the 
variation in the dependent variable.

Next, the multicollinearity measurement was intended to determine whether the 
regression model used had a strong correlation between independent variables by 
looking at the tolerance (T) and variance inflating factor (VIF) values. Ta ble 6 shows 
that the T value for all independent variables had a value of> 0.1 and the VIF value 
for all independent variables had a value of <10. So it can be concluded that there was 
no multicollinearity in this regression model.

Table 7 is a summary of the results of the MLR analysis that had been conducted. 
If the value was Sig. <0.05 from an independent variable, it could be concluded that 
the independent variable had a partial effect on the dependent variable. In addition, by 
looking at the t value of each independent variable, if the t value> the t -table 
(2.01174), it could be concluded that the independent variable affected partially 
(individually) on the dependent variable. Table 7 shows that only the variable of 
working on exercises by using concept mapping had an effect on learning outcomes 
(post-test).

5 Discussion 
LA is also very likely to be used by anyone who is involved and has an interest in 
implementing the learning process. Ifenthaler and Widanapathirana  [26] divided the 
levels of stakeholders who might be involved and interested in LA into several levels, 
namely: mega-level, macro-level, meso-level, and micro -level. Greller and Drachsler  
[9] emphasize that the application of LA can be used by different stakeholders such as 
students, teachers, intelligent tutoring systems, educational institutions, researchers, 
and instructional designers.  
Both students and teachers might be concerned about how the analysis of LA can 
improve the learning quality. How  the students ’  grades will be improved or how 
teachers are helped to adjust a learning strategy, suitable learning materials based on 
students’  need and their personalities to improve. LA as an analytical tool is utilized 
by stakeholders in this case educational institutions to support policy making by 
identifying student ’ s failures or learning needs in online learning. According to 
Campbell, DeBlois, and Diana  [27], the learning analytics process is an iterative 
process consisting of five steps, namely capture, report, predict, act, and refine .  
This paper is focused on the third st ep of the learning analytics process, namely 
predict step.  The analyzed data consisted of students ’  information about their 
learning process such as activities of reading content s, working on  exercises using 
CM, submitting assignments, the number of logins, and the amount of time spent in 
online learning, as well as students ’  learning outcome. The content presented in this 
experiment is related to conceptual knowledge so that it requires deeper learning like 
an application used in learning [28].  
From Table 7,  this research findings  confirmed that  doing exercises using CM is 
the activity that influences the learning outcome . This finding is emphasized by 
Patrick’ s work  [29], where he concludes that concept mapping can affect student 
achievement. Other research findings also agree that the usage of concept mapping in 
teaching enables the students to achieve higher scores rather than students wh o are 
taught by conventional methods  [30] [31]. The same is when Computer -Based 
Concept Mapping (CBCM) is applied in a digital learning environment. CBCM can 
provide meaningful learning for students [32]. This proves that CM can assist students 
to understand the concept through the process of constructing knowledge structures.  
Moreover, the experiment conducted by Hwang, Yang, and Wang  [33] on game -
based learning utilizing CM found that CM can significantly improve student learning

achievement and reduce their cognitive load. Similarly, the results of a recent 
experiment found that CM used as a formative assessment can improve Student 
Engagement and learning outcomes in online learning when compared to using 
conventional assessments  [34]. From the results of their study, it was found that the 
quantity of reading on LMS was not able to predict the learning outcom es of students. 
The study of Huang, Chern, and Lin  [35] have emphasized these research findings.  
Huang et al. [35] state that reading activities in online learning can improve learning 
outcomes but ar e unable to predict learning outcomes, due to students finding 
difficulties in understanding the topics in an article that require a complex level of 
understanding. Huang et al. [35] imply that a special strategy should be needed to help 
students find ideas from an article and as a result of their study was that CM can help 
the students to learn. 
Concept mapping is one of the generative learning activities where this activity 
views learning as an act of construction. Everyone und erstands something by 
integrating new experiences with their existing knowledge structures  [36]. argues that 
students generate perceptions and meanings that are consistent with their prior 
knowledge. Besides, the concept map can be used as a tool in developing reflective 
thinking abilities of students, namely to integrate small pieces of knowledge into a 
complete and elaborate knowledge structure [37].  
Meanwhile, the number of logins was found to c orrelate with the duration of 
interaction with the LMS in accessing learning contents, as well as the other 
independent variables which had a significant correlation between them. Research 
conducted by Asterhan  and H ever [38] also indicate that reading content has a 
positive effect on learning outcomes.  Nevertheless, the amount of interaction in 
building CM had a  more significant correlation with learning outcomes. These 
findings were confirmed by the study of You [39] that identifies several interactions 
in the learning process that can predict learning outcomes. You  [39] states that the 
quantity of interaction with LMS does not necessarily improve learning outcomes but 
the quality of learning behavior can predict learning outcomes. 
In this study, only a few learning activities were included in the non -human 
interaction category  [14], as a result the adjusted R square  value which obtained 
during the experiment  (see section 4) tends to be low . This is because many factors  
that influence the improvement of learning outcome s in online learning setting s [28] 
which were no measured in this research such as  learning motivation [40] , student-
teacher interaction [41], interactions between students  [42], and so on. In addition, 
according to Ismail, et al.  [43] There are four factors that influence student academic 
performance, namely the use of technology, the interaction process, the characteristics 
of the student and the characteristics of the class. 
Other than that,  There hav e been many studies propose solutions to make 
interactive activities effectively support the learning process of students. Evans and 
Sabry [44] implemented three interactive activities: The pace control, self-assessment, 
interactive simulation of his research and time of using the system is a factor affecting 
student results. The results of their study showed that students with better results and 
need less time learning when interacting more with the system. Similarly, according

6 Conclusion 
The number of online learning users increases  which affects the need for an LMS 
increases. LMS has the advantage of managing online learning by adopting traditional 
classrooms. Apart from managing, the LMS records all activities of the teachers and 
students in a feature activity logs. Generated data from this LMS i s known as LA. 
Currently, this LA feature is very important, because data on students ’  online 
activities can be interpreted and used to solve problems in learning and assess the 
effectiveness of online learning. 
This study uses LA for specific online lear ning activities in reading content, 
working on  exercises using CM, submitting assignments, number of logins, login 
duration (time spent learning online). The purpose of this study is to predict which of 
these online learning activities will affect the lear ning outcome.  The results of data 
analysis specifically found the number of logins was closely related to all activities on 
the LMS with a 99% confidence level.  
However, the number of logins was not related to learning outcomes. Similarly, the 
time spent by students in accessing LMS, the Spearman correlation test results, 
showed duration in accessing LMS was closely related to all variables tested except 
for the learning outcomes variable.  
Based on the results of the T-test analysis in the MLR analysis, i t was found that 
only activities working on exercises using CM affected on learning outcomes with a 
sig. value of 0.024, while other activities have a sig value. above 0.05. These results 
prove that compared to the activities tested, the use of CM in train ing is effective in 
helping students learn content which is related to conceptual knowledge.
